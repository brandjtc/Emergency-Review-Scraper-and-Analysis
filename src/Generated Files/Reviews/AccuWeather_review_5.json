    "Content": "Why does the application keep changing so drastically? Latest update made it so that you have to manually start the application every time you restart your phone to get the notification bar to show the temperature. I thought this may have been because I was only using regular Premium to remove ads, so upgraded to Premium+. That didn't help at all. Not even an option to enable auto start in background so the notifications will just show after restart. When this is fixed I will update my review.",
