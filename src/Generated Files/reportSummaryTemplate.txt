The length of the reviews varied (M=X, SD=X). XX% consisted of just a few words (<25 characters), Approximately XX% contained at most one sentence (<200 characters), while XX% contained multiple sentences (>201 characters). Since reviews shorter than a few words (<25 characters) likely contain trivial comments such as [example 1, example 2, example 3], their content is unlikely to have the depth or breath to significantly mention any of the dimensions or sub-dimensions presented in our theoretical model. Thus, we excluded them from the dataset. Thus, our final dataset consisted for X reviews (X% from the Google Play Store, and X% from the AppStore).
