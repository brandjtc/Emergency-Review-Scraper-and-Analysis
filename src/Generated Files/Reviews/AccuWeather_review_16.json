    "Content": "Sad to write this. I was a TWC user years ago but they got silly so I switched to AccuWeather. Been using it ever since. Lately there have been new changes that are not ok. A new graph setup which just sucks compared the standard list style from before, and the ads are absolutely out of hand. If I want to view ANY tab except for home I get a full screen ad. Old features are locked behind a pay wall now. Basic mode gives you ads and less features than premium? I'm switching apps.",
