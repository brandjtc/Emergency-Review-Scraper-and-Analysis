More details about the research project at https://www.sismo.app\r\n\r\nMain features:\r\n\r\n- Earthquake early warnings\r\n- User's reports on felt earthquakes\r\n- Earthquake data from national and international seismic networks starting from magnitude 0.0\r\n- Earthquake notifications through voice synthesizer (<b>only PRO version</b>)\r\n\r\nThe Earthquake Network <b>research project</b> develops a smartphone-based <b>earthquake early warning</b> system able to detect earthquakes in real time and to alert the population in advance. Smartphones are able to detect earthquakes thanks to the accelerometer on-board each device. When an earthquake is detected, users with the application installed are immediatly alerted. Since earthquake waves travel at a finite speed (from 5 to 10 km/s) it is possible to alert the population not yet reached by the damaging waves of the earthquake. For the scientific details about the project please refer to the Frontiers scientific journal at https://bit.ly/2C8B5HI\r\n\r\nNote that the information on earthquakes detected by national and international seismic networks is usually published with a delay ranging from a few minutes to many hours, depending on the seismic network.",com.finazzi.distquake

Emergency,"An emergency is a situation that poses an immediate risk to health, life, property, or environment. Most emergencies require urgent intervention to prevent a worsening of the situation, although in some situations, mitigation may not be possible and agencies may only be able to offer palliative care for the aftermath.\r\n\r\nWhile some emergencies are self-evident (such as a natural disaster that threatens many lives), many smaller incidents require that an observer (or affected party) decide whether it qualifies as an emergency. The precise definition of an emergency, the agencies involved and the procedures used, vary by jurisdiction, and this is usually set by the government, whose agencies (emergency services) are responsible for emergency planning and management.",com.saidkamal.emergency
Emergency Alert,"Emergency Alert is a useful tool for alerting you to urgent events via notifications, even when your phone is on silent. You can even set up your own rules which can be triggered with notification messages from other apps that start or contain text. You can also control the volume of each alert and select different alert sounds, as well as use your own mp3s.\r\n\r\nA useful application for the following scenarios:\r\n- Business continuity\r\n- Urgent notifications from friends or family\r\n- Disaster notifications - Earthquakes, flood alerts and security threats. Please note however that the app does not provide alerts from your local emergency service providers after installation. If you receive alerts regarding tornadoes, flooding or earthquakes, you must manually create a rule to alert you when you receive these messages.\r\n\r\nThe application listens out for notifications that match the rules you have created - when triggered, the app can alert you one of three ways:\r\n\r\n- Silently - This alert simply displays a popup message containing the text of the notification.\r\n\r\n- Vibrate - This alert will vibrate until dismissed, allowing you to be quietly notified of an urgent matter.\r\n\r\n- Play Audio - This alert will alert you with a loud siren until dismissed, even if the device is on silent with media volume turned down.\r\n\r\nYou can also set up a rule to both play audio and vibrate. It's up to you!\r\n\r\nYou can create a rule based on the notification title or body, either starting with or containing text you enter as criteria.\r\n\r\nThe app is also intelligent - if you have a headset plugged in, it will use the current volume so you aren't deafened! Without headphones, the alert will play at full volume through the speaker, ensuring you won't miss an alert.\r\n\r\nPlease Note: The way your device displays notifications may mean that this app may behave differently on different handsets - please test on your device after installation to ensure it is working with your set up. \r\n\r\nFor example, some Samsung devices uses Samsung's built in messaging app which doesn't use Android notifications. You can workaround this issue by using the Android Messages app instead. Any app should work with Emergency Alert as long as it uses the standard Android notification system.",com.mccondach.emergencyalerts

First Aid and Emergency Techni,"First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery.\r\nFirst aid refers to the emergency or immediate care you should provide when a person is injured or ill until full medical treatment is available. For minor conditions, first aid care may be enough. For serious problems, first aid care should be continued until more advanced care becomes available.\r\nFirst aid is vital for saving lives. A person can carry out first aid after a life-threatening incident or injury before the arrival of emergency services.\r\nThe aims of first aid are to preserve life, prevent harm, and promote recovery.\r\nIn first aid, ABC stands for airway, breathing, and circulation.\r\nThe recovery position helps minimize further injury.\r\nCPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It helps maintain the flow of oxygenated blood.\r\nWhile doing chest compressions, you may hear cracks. This is normal.\r\nFirst aid is an emergency measure, generally consisting of simple, often life-saving techniques that most people can train to perform with minimal equipment and no previous medical experience.\r\nFirst aid is not classed as medical treatment and does not replace interventions from a trained medical professional.\r\nAt any moment, you or someone around you could experience an injury or illness. Using basic first aid, you may be able to stop a minor mishap from getting worse. In the case of a serious medical emergency, you may even save a life.\r\nFirst aid covers the steps taken to help an injured or sick person in the first minutes after the event.\r\n\r\nOften this first aid can help someone feel better, recover more quickly, and can even save lives.\r\n\r\nFirst aid can be useful in many different situations, from sprains to electric shocks to heart attacks.\r\nFirst aid might involve a simple action, such as placing a person in the correct position to breathe freely. It might involve a more skilled activity, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if they have stopped breathing.\r\nThe provision of prompt and appropriate first aid can reduce the severity of an injury or illness and in extreme cases, could mean the difference between life and death.\r\nFirst aid refers to medical attention that is usually administered immediately after the injury occurs and at the location where it occurred. It often consists of a one-time, short-term treatment and requires little technology or training to administer. First aid can include cleaning minor cuts, scrapes, or scratches; treating a minor burn; applying bandages and dressings; the use of non-prescription medicine; draining blisters; removing debris from the eyes; massage; and drinking fluids to relieve heat stress.\r\nFirst aid can treat all sorts of minor bumps and scrapes, but you should see a doctor for more serious accidents. You may want to think about getting a first aid kit for your house or training in first aid so that you are prepared to deal with minor accidents.\r\nBasic first aid refers to the initial process of assessing and addressing the needs of someone who has been injured or is in physiological distress due to choking, a heart attack, allergic reactions, drugs or other medical emergencies. Basic first aid allows you to quickly determine a person's physical condition and the correct course of treatment. You should always seek professional medical help as soon as you are able, but following correct first aid procedures can be the difference between life and death. Follow our entire tutorial, or find specific advice by checking out the sections listed above.\r\nFirst aid is the emergency treatment that is given to an injured or sick person or animal, often by someone who does not have medical training. First aid refers to the immediate treatment of an individual(s) that is injured or ill. First aid is not a full medical treatment.",com.fatbelly.firstaidsandemergencytechniques

The alerts of the water gauge & emergency app will help you to prepare for disasters caused by rain or storms. For less critical early warnings that do not require your immediate attention, you can also disable the alarm sound.\r\n\r\n<b>Rain radar</b>\r\nOur app’s map has an integrated rain radar, so you can optimally assess the current weather situation. Colour-coded areas show you where there are storms and rain.

The list view allows users to see the location, magnitude, and time of each earthquake, while the map view provides a visual representation of the earthquakes' locations.\r\nUsers can filter the list of earthquakes based on strength, distance from their current location, and depth. This makes it easier for users to find earthquakes that are relevant to them, and to see how close earthquakes are to their current location.\r\nThe app also includes an alert feature that notifies users about new earthquakes in real-time. This feature can be turned on or off, and users can choose to receive alerts for earthquakes of a certain magnitude or within a certain distance from their current location.\r\nWhether you're a scientist, a geology enthusiast, or just someone who wants to stay informed about earthquakes, this app is for you.\r\nIn addition to the list and map views, this application also provides detailed information about each earthquake, including its depth, magnitude, and intensity. Users can also access a history of past earthquakes, which allows them to track the frequency and distribution of earthquakes over time.\r\nAnother great feature of Earthquake Alert is its ability to display earthquakes on a map using satellite imagery. This provides users with a visual representation of the earthquakes' locations, and makes it easy to see the proximity of earthquakes to populated areas.\r\nAlso the map shows the boundaries of tectonic plates on which earthquakes occur, it is possible to assess the dangerous and safe countries and regions of the planet.\r\nData on earthquakes are taken from the official “USGS” program, “European seismic program” - “EMSC” and “New Zealand GeoNet service”.",com.kb.apps.earthquakes

Emergency Alert,"Emergency Alert is a useful tool for alerting you to urgent events via notifications, even when your phone is on silent. You can even set up your own rules which can be triggered with notification messages from other apps that start or contain text. You can also control the volume of each alert and select different alert sounds, as well as use your own mp3s.\r\n\r\nA useful application for the following scenarios:\r\n- Business continuity\r\n- Urgent notifications from friends or family\r\n- Disaster notifications - Earthquakes, flood alerts and security threats. Please note however that the app does not provide alerts from your local emergency service providers after installation. If you receive alerts regarding tornadoes, flooding or earthquakes, you must manually create a rule to alert you when you receive these messages.\r\n\r\nThe application listens out for notifications that match the rules you have created - when triggered, the app can alert you one of three ways:\r\n\r\n- Silently - This alert simply displays a popup message containing the text of the notification.\r\n\r\n- Vibrate - This alert will vibrate until dismissed, allowing you to be quietly notified of an urgent matter.\r\n\r\n- Play Audio - This alert will alert you with a loud siren until dismissed, even if the device is on silent with media volume turned down.\r\n\r\nYou can also set up a rule to both play audio and vibrate. It's up to you!\r\n\r\nYou can create a rule based on the notification title or body, either starting with or containing text you enter as criteria.\r\n\r\nThe app is also intelligent - if you have a headset plugged in, it will use the current volume so you aren't deafened! Without headphones, the alert will play at full volume through the speaker, ensuring you won't miss an alert.\r\n\r\nPlease Note: The way your device displays notifications may mean that this app may behave differently on different handsets - please test on your device after installation to ensure it is working with your set up. \r\n\r\nFor example, some Samsung devices uses Samsung's built in messaging app which doesn't use Android notifications. You can workaround this issue by using the Android Messages app instead. Any app should work with Emergency Alert as long as it uses the standard Android notification system.",com.mccondach.emergencyalerts

Asean Fire Alert Tool,"Alert on Forest Fire Hotspots from daily Satellite Imagery.\n\n\nThe public can view ASEAN hotspots obtained from Satellite imagery provided either by the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC) or from the Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN). These hotspot data-sets are updated daily and displayed spatially overlaid on the map.\n\n\nThe Fire Weather Index (FWI) for the ASEAN region is provided by the Malaysian Meteorological Services as part of its Fire Danger Rating System (FDRS). These heat-maps provide numerical ratings for general fire danger & intensity and is an indicator of the difficulty for fire control.\n\n\nAdditionally, the ASEAN Fire Alert Tool can help check & send push notification alerts on specific land regions you have already marked out for automated daily hotspot monitoring and/or for changes in the Fire Weather Indices. Push notifications are sent at approx 1900hrs (GMT+8).\n\n\nYou can register to mark your land regions at this website: https://www.AseanFireAlert.org\n\n\nThis is a free service.\n\n\nNote: As we only collect Hotspot Data for the ASEAN Region, only regions marked in the ASEAN region would receive such hotspot alerts/FDRS-FWI alerts, if any.\n\n\n\nThis Version 3.07 (27 March 2018)\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nProject funded by USAID LEAF and IFACS.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app and its associated website is made possible by the support of the American People through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
