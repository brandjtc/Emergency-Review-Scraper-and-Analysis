This POS of an app throws up their damn adds from unverified third party scammers. You barely touch that screen anywhere other than a tiny closing tab and it auto loads some snooping shopping app that wants to peak at all your data and notifications. This used to be a trustworthy weather app. They've sold out to con artists. Don't bother.",
