The length of the reviews varied (M={meanLength}, SD={standardDeviation}). Approximately {shortReviewPercent}% consisted of just a few words (<25 characters), Approximately {middleReviewPercent}% contained at most one sentence (<200 characters), while {largeReviewPercent}% contained multiple sentences (>201 characters). Since reviews shorter than a few words (<25 characters) likely contain trivial comments such as "{sampledShortRev[0]}", "{sampledShortRev[1]}", and "{sampledShortRev[2]}." Their content is unlikely to have the depth or breadth needed to significantly invoke any of the dimensions or sub-dimensions presented in our theoretical model. Therefore, we excluded them from the dataset. Thus, after removing {shortCount} reviews, our final dataset consisted of {reviewTotal} reviews, with approximately ({playStorePercent}% being from the Google Play Store and {appStorePercent}% from the Apple AppStore).
