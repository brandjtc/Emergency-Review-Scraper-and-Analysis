We really rely on an app now for this? Kind of a bad contingency plan - I seem to remember beibg in Paris in 2017 when the customs and security servers and computers went down in the airport. That was a great mess. Hmmm no one seems to think that was something to learn from.  oh well, I guess I can go study what I think has been planned and then go wander around ahead of time so I become familiar with the road to the last bottle of water and toilet paper in my local grocery. Or look up and write down all the ways I can get in touch with my cell carrier to tell them my service is not working. Does anyone have a white pages phone book? I have to report it online now because they no longer have people answering phones for customer service."
