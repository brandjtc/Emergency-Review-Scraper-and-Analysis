    "Content": "I echo all other recent reviews. As an app that I have already paid for the premium features, the feature set has been drastically reduced and requires a monthly subscription. You can now only see hourly projections up to 12 hrs. Essentially every other hourly or short term accuracy based feature has been eliminated. The 4 hour outlook is still available, but has limited used. It is essentially a fake app now that you have to subscribe to. Deleting this app for good.",
