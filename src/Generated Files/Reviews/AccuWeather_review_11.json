Doesn't matter what network I'm on, fiber via WiFi, 3g, 4g, 5g.. it's the app. Can't see what the temperature was earlier in the same day, much less further back in time. If it's 2pm, I can't even see what happened at 1pm. Weather underground allows viewing the last 12 hours at least. So far it's the only one that does.",
