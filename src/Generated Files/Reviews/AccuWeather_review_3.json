    "Content": "I love this app for the weather accuracy of the circle and line graphs; however, it takes a very long time to load on my phone, and it drops constantly. I have to keep going back into the app to get all the information that I need. I own a business that is weather dependent. Extremely frustrating! None of my other apps drop. Please fix this problem so that I can give you 5 stars!",
