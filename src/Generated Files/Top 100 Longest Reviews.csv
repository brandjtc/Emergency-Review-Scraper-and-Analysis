0,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"This app truly has the potential to be invaluable! Unfortunately cannot rate it five stars with a few things that make it irritable/unreliable to use the app.

The app was introduced to Me because I live in a dangerous area with lots of activity on the daily, not to mention My city as a whole, and as of recent I’ve been trying to make a habit of listening to the scanner when out & about for My safety and added awareness. I was immediately captivated by the recommendation and installed the app as well as having My brother and mom do the same to immediately add each other on August 30th, 2021 around 7pm.

The first, and perhaps most problematic issue, is when sifting through your contact list to find anyone you know who’s already using this app…instead of the app grouping all of those contacts already using the app and listing them at the top in alphabetical (or SOME form of chronological order) separate from the rest who aren’t where you then decide to invite whoever you’d like to invite to start using the app, this app has your contacts ALL MIXED UP in no order whatsoever! It’s SO unorganized. 
Another thing is, although I do appreciate the logo of this app beside the names of those who are using the app, it is the only time it doesn’t identify which phone number for the contact it is (work, mobile, iPhone, etc.) - the problem with this is, a lot of people have both a work and personal cell phone and could have an account for both (and I’d rather send request to their personal phone and not their work unless they’d like otherwise), OR that I could be sending a request to an old phone number that they no longer use but I haven’t deleted (that the service provider has assigned to a new individual) and I’ve sent a request to a stranger……if I could still see which of the contact’s number is listed under the name, even with the app logo, that would be a really good (and SAFE) thing! Because remember, this is someone we are enabling to see and have access to our location/whereabouts 24/7 if we have the Ghostmode disabled.

Speaking of Ghostmode, it would be optimal if we could choose which of our friends can and cannot see our location, if we wished to disable it for several minutes, an hour, a few hours, or indefinitely until we manually turn it back on, keep it on indefinitely, have it on for several minutes, on for an hour or a few hours (if attending a concert, going to a party in an area unfamiliar to them, going on a date with someone new, traveling somewhere out of town/state or country and sharing your location with family/loved ones/best friends/select few as well as having the added option to choose and use the app’s Agent would make it an added safety feature), etc. Because NOT having these options has limited my decision with who I add and invite to use the app, who’s requests I accept, kind of defeats the purpose of trying to keep everyone in-the-know and safe  without having to sacrifice My own privacy.

Lastly, the distance listed on the labels/titles of the notifications of the Incidents on the app is not accurate. As aforementioned, where I live is FULL of activity, and because I walk/run/drive up and down all over, I know these incidents saying they’re 1/3 of a mile away from Me are over half mile away, and I don’t understand what’s listed at 841 feet away from Me is actually 1/3 of a mile away.

Aside from My criticism, My takeaway and appreciation for this app are the real-time notifications from the Citizen app users, which gives us all an opportunity to “neighborhood watch” collectively, with its only option to live broadcast what is happening; that way no one gets to tell the narrative- we see it for ourselves. The app also makes/adds news notifications as well, wherever it gets its intel from… And both notifications created by the app users and the app itself can be updated with a video  from nearby app users or with more information from the app itself. I like that we can engage on these news notifications with commentary or reactions, I sometimes learn more about what’s happening in the incident from the comments than I do from the updates or lack thereof! AND that the news follows YOU and alerts you of what’s happening around your current/exact/real-time whereabouts, and it’s not stationary like your home or work address, etc.

But you’re not limited to just your surroundings, you CAN pick from a drop down list of major U.S. cities or globally…all up to you.
You will get alerts of notifications near/at the whereabouts of your friends who are sharing their locations with you, yet these special alerts make it easier to instantly message them to ask if they’re okay without a thought, as we naturally would react. If you happen to be in the same area as someone who’s sharing their location with you, you’ll be alerted of that as well with the option to message them “hello” and kind of encourages you to perhaps see them, even if briefly…this is purely a social feature though, and nothing relevant to news. In the Direct Messages section, you’ll find you can create group messages and that’s not a bad idea for family/friends/coworkers, you get it…

I’ll continue to revise this review and come up with ideas, I always have many ;), as I become more acclimated with the app.",5280,6481297c7a3b99eab485f616
1,Storm Shield ,"It could be coming down on the county that You or a Loved one lives in. And I could tell ya way back in the 50’s & 60’s even back then Your Phone Holds Now more information than the weather person had sitting in front of them back then…. In 1964 I was in the playground at 8:48pm at the corner of 28th & Clyde Park. The Southeast corner. There stood a two story school building. I went from  K- -6th grade there. But that day durning school I always got in the class room but one time that did not have Windows so I could see the playground . This special day I was day dreaming as they were setting up the caravelle, the one time only a double Farris Wheel !! Later that night I was lucky enough to tag along with my Big Brother up there. Well till we got up there and he said at 8:30pm meet me right here !!

2,KATWARN,"Ist die App hilfreich? Ja, aber mit deutlichen Einschränkungen:

- Katastrophenwarnungen gibt es lediglich für 31 Landkreise. In Deutschland gibt es 295 Landkreise. Eine Liste der unterstüzten Landkreise findet sich auf der Internetseite von Katwarn. 
- Bei bundeslandweiten Katastrophen wird für ""verschiedene"" Bundesländer gewarnt. Welche, wird nicht näher genannt. 
- In der Beschreibung und in der App werden auf diese Einschränkungen nur sehr ""leise"" hingewiesen. Das Mindeste wäre ein Hinweis bei der Auswahl eines Postleitzahlgebiets. 
- Gut: Warnungen des Deutschen Wetterdienstes (DWD) werden in allen Landkreisen für die beiden höchsten Stufen gemeldet. Also für amtliche Unwetterwarnungen (Warnstufe rot) und Warnungen vor extremem Unwetter (Warnstufe dunkelrot/violett). Erläuterungen dazu finden sich auf der Webseite Wettergefahren.
- ich wünsche mir eine in der Meldung eingeblendete Gefahrenskala, die mir eine Einordnung erlaubt. Das Wort ""Extremwetter"" sagt mir im Zweifel nichts. 
- Für Unwetterwarnungen wird der Standard iOS Hinweiston verwendet. Angenehm wäre mir ein eigener Unwetter Hinweiston. Für Katastrophenwarnungen wird offenbar bereits ein extra Alarmton verwendet.
- Zumindest mein iPhone unterschlägt öfters Pushnachrichten, z.B. der Tagesschau App. So habe ich Zweifel ob eine Pushwarnung der App mich zuverlässig erreichen würde.
- Auch wird immer davor gewarnt, dass bei einem Unwetter das Mobilfunknetz ausfallen kann. Einschränkungen oder Überlastung des mobilen Internets sind natürlich auch im Katastrophenfall keinesfalls auszuschließen.
- Vielleicht könnte folgendes Verfahren Zuverlässigkeit und Geschwindigkeit verbessern: Quittiert KatWarn nicht innerhalb von 2 Minuten den Empfang einer Warnmeldung, so wird eine SMS versendet. 
- Wenn ich die, pathetisch ""Schutzengel"" genannte, automatische Lokalisierung aktiviere, dann wird in der Menüleiste dauerhaft das Symbol für Ortungsdienste angezeigt.
Leider sieht man so aber nicht mehr ob andere Apps den Ortungsdienst aktiviert haben und ihrerseits mit GPS den Akku stark belasten. Wir haben hier also eine Alarmglocke, der leicht aus Versehen, der Saft ausgehen kann.
  Ich frage mich, ob nicht eine kurze Ortung alle 10 Minuten ausreichen würde?
Wie sehr die Schutzengel Funktion meinen Akku belastet, muss ich noch herausfinden. In der Anleitung heißt es dazu:
""Durch Verwendung der  energieeffizienten Ortung über Basisstationen und WLAN:Zugangspunkte (und nicht über  GPS) wird der Akku nur geringfügig belastet. Die App wird dabei nur aktiv, wenn Sie sich in  einem größeren Rahmen von Ihrer aktuellen Position entfernt haben (ca. 2 km) bzw. wenn  Sie den hellblauen Schutzbereich auf Ihrem Display verlassen.  
  Obwohl beim iPhone dabei durchgängig das Ortungssymbol in der Statusleiste angezeigt  wird, ist dies daher nicht automatisch mit einem erhöhten Energieverbrauch  gleichzusetzen.''

Die App kann informieren. Auf sie verlassen sollte man sich aber nicht!

Wer die Bevölkerung zuverlässig und flächendeckend warnen möchte, sollte mal einen Blick nach Österreich werfen. Dort gibt es ein SirenenWarnsystem, das in den letzten Jahren so ausgebaut wurde, dass es nahezu in jedem Winkel Österreichs zu hören ist. Handy, Smartphone, eine funktionierende Datenverbindung oder überhaupt irgendein eingeschaltetes Gerät sind dort für die erste Warnung nicht nötig. 
Den zweiten Blick würde ich nach Japan werfen. Dort gibt es ein über _mehrere_ Kanäle laufendes, _praxisbewährtes_ Katastrophenwarnsystem. 

Bei der letzten Unwetterwarnung im Herbst 2014 war es so:
Die Warnung, ausgegeben um 16:18 Uhr meldete meine KatWarn-App um 16:41. Die KatWarn SMS mit der gleichen Warnung erreichte mich um 16:21 Uhr. Mein iPhone hatte die ganze Zeit eine perfekte Internetverbindung.

Update 31.3.2015:
Eine WarnApp, die nicht warnt, ist leider zu 100% unbrauchbar. Deshalb stufe ich von 3 auf 1 Stern herab. Die heutigen Warnmeldungen vor Extremwetter wurden weder für meine eingetragenen Orte, noch für den Schutzengelbereich (als ""Mitteilung"" in iOS) signalisiert. Erst nach einem Aufruf der App sah ich die Warnungen, bzw. kamen auch die Meldungen. Das war dann 6 Stunden nach dem Ausgabezeitpunkt.
Es ist leider auch unerheblich ob es an der App liegt, oder an irgendetwas anderem. Eine WarnApp, die nicht, oder nur sehr unzuverlässig, warnt, ist überflüssig.",4358,64812f8b7a3b99eab4861f2f
3,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"Seriously, I just came to leave a review at 4:30am whole following an event in my neighborhood bc I’m so sick of the terrible interface after over a year of patiently sucking it up (actually, 2+ yrs?). The user videos of live, serious, and breaking events being shared in my own neighborhood that i’m trying to observe are 80% covered with other info like the comment/info menu tabs to toggle to the radio updates and/or user comments, playback controls, reporting information, map toggle, and thumbnails to other citizen videos. 

If you think you can simply tap to view a full screen video of some breaking live breaking news incident, and then tap back to the other navigation tabs/menus/thumbnails, well you’d be wrong. 

If you try to tap the open/active video (live or otherwise) to full screen, tapping it only sends ::prayer hands:: or other emoji reactions on your behalf. Thanks, I guess I’m 12. 

If you think you can swipe down to hide the lower screen comment/detail menu tabs and various thumbnail and navigation overlays, guess again. Nope. The incident page/feed closes completely and sends you back to the main map for monitoring incidents in your neighborhood. 

Ok, what if you geeeently and caasaaarefully nudge the lower comment/detail menu tabs down to get them and the other video thumbnails/navigation controls to hide while I view this video? Well, still not really. Those elements still won’t hide to give you a clean full screen view, but will at least drop down maybe 25% and at least leave you now with only a 55% covered window to watch a video of some important/breaking event in your neighborhood, with the rest of the screen (sometimes the most important details of the live feed) peppered with a glom of thumbnails and menu tab overlays that refuse to fully minimize, not to mention thousands of floating emoji reactions during a live feed that you can’t seem to hide under any circumstance unless you tab out of the incident and then back in again, while being SURE TO TOUCH NOTHING ELSE. If you tap the screen once to instinctively try to hide the menus/navigation/etc and go to full screen video like EVERY OTHER APP in the world (no, there is no <—> full screen toggle), the emoji reactions will start shooting like flying toasters again and block the entire (tiny) area of actual viewable video space...til you just shut it down and give up and close the app entirely, hostage situation be damned (yeah, i live in LA, the app carries some pretty significant news from right on my street, even letting me watch when a fugitive took an opening and ran up the street, I was able to follow him to my location where he slid into the crawl space under my building, changed his clothes, and then took off again. Yep, useful app. But i still couldn’t get full screen video, so at least I had my own eyeballs to fall back on).

Have some faith in your users, Citizen. We use YouTube, Apple News, Twitter, etc. on a daily basis, and seem to manage just fine moving between full screen content windows and tapping again to access additional navigation, menus, map view, etc. You need to implement basic full-screen viewing of live/archived incident videos, with a single toggle to such, and stop burying important real life content under countless other menus and overlays that you can’t shrink or hide or get out of the way without exiting the incident completely. Like we’re somehow going to forget where we are and lose our way back and not credit Citizen with our great content. Well I’ve dealt with this for over a year and it’s still no better, just absolutely stupid to not provide full screen video and make me squint and tap and navigate and exit and reload and turn a video and try to squint to the video behind/between the thumbnails to see if my neighbor’s house is the one that just caught on fire or not. Get some common sense UI/UX into this app bc it’s just pathetic after this much time to make the appropriate updates.",3964,6481297c7a3b99eab485f88d
4,Alberta Emergency Alert,"If for example the tornado is in the NE and is not coming in the SE of Calgary then why would it affect the SE Calgary when it’s happening in the NE in Calgary? Could it be about the specific area instead of the whole city Because I don’t want the whole city I only want within the SE because I avoid travelling to the North in Calgary due to the pandemic! It would be more effective if it says for what location in the city so that I am not worked up so bad because I have been like that ever since I was 7 wasn’t truly scared until I was 14 years old when my foster parents made me scared but at least now I am turning 21 I am trying to be brave of the storm that’s coming because it’s usually rare in the SE in Calgary but only non damage tornadoes in the city only 2 damaging tornadoes so far rest were not fatal enough to make it a warning! I hope you understand and see if it’s possible and I don’t mind the buzz noise because it gets enough attention to Alberta that this x storm is happening but at the same time it makes it scary a bit because of location but to make it not annoying if you can mute it because some people are deaf and can’t see maybe the words should be bigger I find because when I read a television it’s so blurry I cannot see the words like its so small like what is it saying I myself can’t read far I am a nearsighted vision which is why I am wearing glasses but not helping to see farther could you make it a bit not too big but enough that I can actually see the words when you make the alert it would be much easier on my eye sight is not great but at least I got rid of those little tiny dots that were around my eyes so unlucky that my optometrist made a very big lie about my vision being 20/20 no I am near sighted when I read something it goes close to my eyes but not so close to make them blind I read a not so far enough to not wear glasses when I take them off everything is so blurry I can not see where I’m going and what I am doing etc. I just wanted to express it so that it happens with every television also if you can send it by telephone what would it look and sound like if it works I don’t know! Also how do you send those alerts is it special training or is it typing and sending it to house per house and does it cost money to do so I would absolutely like to know because it would make it interesting to learn all of that stuff! I am not blind but I can’t see far without glasses it’s that I am a nearsighted you might not be but it would be best if it was big to see so I don’t have to stand walk to the TV and see what part of the city it’s at!

Other than that keep going on your good job you are totally worth a lot of money to letting people know that a tornado or something is going to happen it’s very helpful for me because I can plan when to go and where to go and make it a timely fashion with my day program it’s great because one day something does happen and we aren’t prepared then we are totally screwed and I have been noticing that storms cost money after it damages maybe we shouldn’t have a tornado because nothing good about it neither thunder or hail those does more damage than making a healthy environment so I don’t know the point of thunder and hail with wind like seriously does it have to be a severe storm over the summer even if it’s hot no because it’s not necessary like Mexico they get very hot and clear at night why can it not happen here in Calgary! Anyways please do send me an email regarding to all my questions if you can think about my questions and reply because I would like to know just do it anonymously if you can so that my mom doesn’t see the email only myself because if my bitchy mother knows she always flips people off just in seconds she will be such a big two faced *****. I am letting you know that is how my mother is quite like that some times just so u are aware!",3877,6481245f7a3b99eab485e00f
5,Noonlight: Feel Protected 24/7,"This app is an absolute must have for everybody. Man, woman, child, old, young, single, etc... everybody benefits from installing this app. And it is totally worth the $3 a month. If you are willing to pay for a security system at your house why wouldn’t you pay for this app. Having to pay for it increases my piece of mind actually. Paying for it means they have the resources to hire caring, dedicated, and well trained staff to man the phones 24/7. Paying for it means they have the resources to continually develop and improve the app, making additional app integrations a reality rather than just an idea. I can’t wait until this app is fully integrated with Uber ( hopefully Lyft isn’t far behind) and Facebook. Just more ways to make me feel safe. And think about it 911 isn’t free. If you pay a phone bill, landline or mobile, you pay a surcharge for the 911 service and if you pay local taxes you are funding the 911 service. Safety is not free and it shouldn’t be. Funds should be collected to train staff and implement new safety procedures. Now it shouldn’t cost an arm and a leg either but the $3 per month charge for this app is chump change. And the billing is done so conveniently especially if you have an iPhone. I never have to worry about remembering to pay for my subscription. It automatically bills my iTunes account each month and that equals even more piece of mind. 

I tested the app right after I installed it and it was so simple and easy to use. I kinda wish you didn’t have to hold the button the whole time but I guess they need some sort of signal to send for help and I honestly can’t think of any better way to do it. The app creators were geniuses and I am so thankful to them for developing this app. This is an absolute must have for everybody. And make sure you put it on your first page or Home Screen so that it is right at your fingertips. I have an iPhone and have the app in my dock at the bottom of the screen so no matter where I am or what I’m doing on my phone the app is right at my fingertips. Don’t just install this app and forget about it. Use it. The more you remember to use it when you are just feeling uneasy or with a sketchy Uber driver the more likely you will remember you have the app and actually use it in a real emergency.

I love that there are live people manning the phone lines and that they both text and call. Who knows what situation you might be in and you can’t always answer a phone call. Texting has become such an integral part of life today I couldn’t imagine this app really working without having a texting feature. 

I have not had to use this app in an actual emergency yet and I hope I never have to but it is so reassuring to know that help is literally a fingertip away when you really need it. I read almost every review in the App Store and the only complaint I came across were those whining about having to pay for the app. I came across a similar app to this one and it was $3 a week not a month and had horrible reviews. This app has a 4.5 rating and that’s only because of the complaints about price while similar apps have a 3.6 rating and multiple complaints about availability and response time, app crashes and poor development. This is the app!! Get it and send the first month free to everyone you know. Post it on Facebook. Encourage every person you know to get this app. I am a single mother with a 14 yo son and I have this app on both of our phones. I also insisted that my mom, sister, aunts, cousins, and friends get the app for themselves too. I can’t emphasize enough how crucial and beneficial it is to have this app. Please do yourself a favor and download it today!!",3677,648136937a3b99eab4867dd0
6,PulsePoint Respond,"Pulse point needs to make two decisions for this app to be a great one. 

1 Is this app for trained professionals or for citizens with first aid/CPR training?

2 Is this app primarily a data driven app or is it solely to connect those trained citizens to incidents requiring need?

On the first question- Of course the answer is that it is for citizens (I think), but it is written and displayed like it is for first responders.  There is simply too many esoteric words and symbols that a non EMS / fire person would not know. When I opened the app I immediately saw that there was a medical emergency near my house. My HR rose and I was wondering, is this active? Do I need to rush out the door right now?  I had to look up what E39 (in green) and M12 (in beige) meant. I eventually got the picture that it's not a current emergency but those symbols and colors MUST be discarded in favor of a system that shows the user 2 things; is it active? And have EMS fire already arrived? 

This leads to the second point which is for this app to be successful, it MUST be able to connect trained citizens to an incident faster than EMS / fire can arrive. If it cannot do that, then the app is useless. In addition to the esoteric colors and symbols, the map is flooded with old emergencies that have happened hours ago. I personally don't care about any of these, what can I at this point do about them? Now it may be helpful to have a ""historical"" mode where data from last 24 hrs is displayed so a user can understand where patterns of need (if possible to determine) will be. Otherwise my map is full of points that cloud my ability to see any current emergencies. 

In addition, (to really beat this horse dead) I received a notification of a traffic collision nearby. I clicked the notification and opened the app. The map was again full of points (active and cleared) and I had no idea where the accident was. In effect, the notification was useless. 

Summary:

In many cases EMS and fire dispatched via traditional means will be the fastest response to incidents of need. But if there is a way to decrease time to first care by using citizens with medical knowledge, then the app must make it exceedingly simple for the average citizen to find a casualty and provide care until first responders arrive. This app could actually change the definition of first responders if designed right!

Recommendations: 

1 Get rid of confusing symbols and colors. Replace with active or arrived (meaning EMS is on scene no need to assist)

2 Get rid of historical data and keep only active incidents that a citizen would need to go to. 

3 Make notifications relevant by zooming right onto the incident and then connecting with maps so a user could immediately navigate to incident. 

4 Give the option for a buffer 1, 5, or 10 miles. I would like to follow more than just 1 department but the data was overwhelming. By allowing a buffer, only incidents near the user will be displayed and notified. This allows me to follow many departments and receive only notifications where I may be able to assist due to my proximity. 

5 Enable a way for users to upload their qualifications (CPR/AED, off duty EMS, doctors etc) to the app so that we don't get random people wanting to be heroes coming to a scene and not being able to be effectual.

Cheers, I hope this review proves helpful.",3371,648137457a3b99eab48692fa
7,Noonlight: Feel Protected 24/7,Let me first start off saying I never really write reviews but I HAD to write one for Noonlight. So I absolutely love this app. It definitely helps with my anxiety at times for one. But I’m not going to lie I did wonder if this app really works probably like most of the people who first get it but I just always assumed it did. I had it for a while now I believe right after they came out with it as safe trek. So to my story lol I was tired and my little one was not at all and no matter what she would not go to bed and it was 1am but we are use to a different time so it was actually 2am. So I gave her my phone to watch Netflix in the bed next to me while I was in a on and off sleep state(Please don’t judge me). So she ended up going into the app pressing the button of course not knowing my pin so they text asking was everything ok. The text also said they would call if it was ok to answer. They called twice and my little one actually picked up the phone the second time for 2 seconds and then hung it up so she could get back to her show. With no response and the pick up hand up they sent officers out to the location of my phone. My mom boyfriend answered the door told them I wasn’t there and then came to see if I was and woke me up saying the police is outside saying your alarm went off. I got up thinking it was my car alarm and then realized how would they know where to go if my car alarm is going off being that I’m not home. So I got my phone from my little one and saw the text message. As I was going down stairs the officers told my mom boyfriend if they can come in to see if I was here(he still didn’t tell them I was there at that point) he said no that they have dogs that are out. The police officer said well we are going to come in(brake the door door down). So turn around and run up the stairs to grab my ID because I know they are going to want to know I am who I say I am. They say we see your car is here from out of town and continue asking me am I sure I’m ok and I explained my daughter had my phone which she was at the door while I was outside talking to them. And she had pressed the button and showed them the text messages. I told them I was at my mom house and gave him my driver license and they ran them in the system and he said my mom boyfriend was acting suspicious saying I wasn’t there. I said he didn’t know because the room door was closed but he came to wake me up. They said ok have a nice day. And I apologize for having to waste there time. I went into the app to cancel it still and the next day got a text from the app making sure I was ok. I know this is long but it’s my story as to why I love this app and I love that I know it works. I hate that it wasted everyone’s time and feel terrible about it. I would recommend this app to everyone. I actually told my sister to download it because she was catching a Uber one day late from work. A couple days later her son pressed the button in there apartment building and had 3-4 trucks of police officers jump out searching there building looking for her. This app really works and if I could give it 10 stars I definitely would. Thank you Noonlight for always being there!! ❤️❤️,3190,648136937a3b99eab4867302
8,PulsePoint Respond,"Great app, I use it every single day. It is immensely helpful as a firefighter to know what is going on in the city and as a quick reference for directions, primarily for runs that do not occur in our first-in district. It is so accurate, it is even helpful in our first-in apartment complexes as it will show the notification within the map screen over top of the side of the building the unit is on. This is so helpful!

That being said, the app still does leave some things to be desired. The biggest is the lack of a numerical address on EMS runs. I’m not sure why fire and other emergencies all have an address with an automatic route button that links you to Google maps, but EMS runs do not. I can only think that this is related to a fear of HIPPA violations, but it shouldn’t be a factor since this app also links you to the radio which speaks the numerical address as a public broadcast. In no way does this use patients names or identify anything that would create a violation. Because there are no numerical addresses, or route feature, for the 85% of our runs which are EMS, this is a huge deal for me. When our technology in our truck goes down, PulsePoint is always our first back up. Many times, this is even our primary, as it has proven itself to be more accurate than our own computer in our truck on occasion. INCLUDE ADDRESS NUMBERS FOR EMS RUNS PLEASE! 

What’s funny is that as a firefighter and a medic, I am frequently called to the location of a cardiac arrest. This means that I’m the closest person in our fire department to this emergency, but I’ve never had a cardiac arrest CPR alert go off. Therefore, I cannot confirm or comment on the reliability of this feature. In addition, if this feature does not utilize a numerical address because this is an EMS run, this will also create an issue. However, if it does list the address for a cardiac arrest with CPR needed, then this theory conflicts with the rest of the EMS runs which don’t utilize numerical information.

As far as reliability, it’s a 9.5 out of 10. Occasionally, the app will display the same two trucks for every run on the board, but it is easily fixed by shutting down the app and opening it back up. This is inconvenient during an emergency when I’m trying to confirm a location prior to getting in the truck quickly as the driver, but it does not take a huge amount of time.

After the last update, I would also like to comment on the increased look of the entire set up. It used to be very easy on an Android to see the different colors on the screen which indicate the status of a vehicle, but iPhones were terrible because they had a very poor color palette. With the improvement, it is very easy to see which colors are which and they utilize a much more legible font. This was by far the best improvement to date.

Overall, this app is a wonderful idea and the application has been nothing short of excellent. As with anything, there is definitely room for much needed improvement, but it is nothing so extreme the app is not still worth its weight in gold. Great job PulsePoint and keep on doing what you’re doing.",3121,648137457a3b99eab4869338
9,KATWARN,"... bekommt sie oft keine zweite Chance mehr.
Hier ein kostenloser Usabilty-Test.
Ich habe die App vor ca. einem Jahr bereits deinstalliert weil sie mich mit Fehlmeldungen wahnsinnig gemacht hatte.
Aber ich war neugierig und wollte sehen wie sehr nachgebessert wurde.
Zuerst wollte ich die ""Engel-Benachrichtigungsfunktion"" einschalten und bekam den Hinweis, dass ich in den Benachrichtigungseinstellungen meines Handys die App auf ""ja"" stellen sollte mit einem Direktlink dahin. Also klicke ich darauf, gelange in die Benachrichtigungseinstellungen meines Handys, stelle alles auf ""ja, ich will benachrichtigt werden"" und kehre zu Katwarn zurück.
Aber die ""Engel-Funktion"" ist nicht aktivierbar.
Dann schloss ich Katwarn, öffnete über die Benutzereinstellungen das Benachrichtigungscenter meines Handys, rufe dort die Benachrichtigungseinstellungen von Katwarn auf und stelle dann alles auf ""ja, ich will"" und schliesse alles wieder.
Danach öffne ich Katwarn und die ""Engel-Funktion"" ist immer noch nicht aktivierbar mit dem Hinweis: Ich möge doch bitte die Benachrichtigungsfunktion an schalten :(
Da war ich schon am kochen...
Dann dachte ich: ""ok, vielleicht geht es nicht, weil ich noch keinen Ort eingestellt habe"", obwohl das an für sich irrelevant sein müsste.
Also öffne ich den Ort, sehe eine Deutschlandkarte und ein Eingabefeld und gebe meine PLZ ein und bestätige das. Nichts passiert.
Dann klicke ich in das Feld, gebe Hamburg ein und erhalte als Auswahl nur Hamburg in den USA :(
Dann dachte ich, ich könnte durch tippen evtl. eine Positionsnadel setzen, wie das in allen meinen Erdbeben-Apps funktioniert. Ging auch nicht :(

- Meine Meinung -
Ich konzipiere seit vielen Jahren Apps und komplexe Internetseiten und bin fit in Ui/Ux und User-Center-Design.
Mich als User ärgert die Einstellung: Wir bringen das Projekt erst mal raus und der Rest kommt später und als Experte bin ich fassungslos.
Wir reden hier nicht über eine App, die Bäume bestimmen soll und da fehlt vielleicht ein Inhalt oder sie hat sonst Bedienfehler.
Nein, dass ist eine App von einer Katastrophenschutzbehörde, die ihre Bürger vor ernsten Gefahren warnen und damit schützen möchte! 
Und das die App dann nicht von Anfang an einfach funktioniert, stößt bei mir auf null Toleranz, weil dadurch das wichtige Vertrauen in die App und auch in die Behörde verloren geht. 
Auch das zu spät gewarnt oder gar nicht gewarnt wird, wie es einige schreiben, wäre für mich nicht hinnehmbar und alle Erklärungen dazu (wir können nicht alle Betriebssysteme abdecken, das Update bei Apple dauert so lange, das ist teuer, die API kann das nicht, blablabla) sind Ausreden die ich schon so oft gehört habe und die das fehlende Bewusstsein für das Benutzerverhalten aufzeigt.
Sollte in ein paar Jahren die App zuverlässig laufen, werden alle User, die die App mal ausprobiert und deinstalliert haben, sie nicht wieder installieren weil sie eine schlechte Erfahrung damit gemacht haben. Und damit erreicht man nicht mehr so viele wie man könnte und damit ist der Sinn der App - möglichst viele zu warnen - dahin.

10,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"I appreciated knowing what’s happening in my neighborhood. But search your heart and you’ll see this app is one of the more insidious things you’ve ever put on your phone. The bounty “join the hunt” notifications a few weeks ago made me sick to my stomach. (And would have even if they had somehow rightfully identified the suspected arsonist.) It doesn’t take the imagination of Jordan Peele or Rod Sterling to see how dangerous and out of control an app like this can get without extreme editorial and ethical standards from the top down. It’s become clear to me over the last year that there is no such morality or decency coming from the top of this application. 

First, I started to doubt the accuracy of the reports I was getting, an axe here, a fire or man spotted with a knife every few hours. It didn’t match the reality of my neighborhood, and the notifications all came through with the same urgency, the same sense of impending awful. I don’t think I’ve seen a “knife” or “machete” in public life, and certainly not enough to buzz hundreds of thousands of people multiple times a week. But, I said, when there is something near me, (like a tragic building fire last summer, or the time the LAPD spent 3 hours swarming my neighborhood from the ground and sky looking for a “suspected burglar”) I’ll want to know some context. I used to laugh at the absurdity of the notifications, especially when I’m notified about squabbles happening 6 miles away. I’d read the comments and more times than not l, I’d see a kind of frightened fury that made me feel uncomfortable. So much hate and bias, and gossip in the feed of each “incident”. Spooky!

Last week, an arsonist started setting fires in the hills of Los Angeles, a terrifying crime with awful consequences for all of LA. The app decided to raise a reward for information leading to the arrest of whoever did it. And in the process the community and the app appear to have identified the wrong man, and have continued to foster an environment where fear and “vigilante” crime reporting/solving run rampant. It’s shameful, and lame! 

Now, after learning Citizen is offering a summonable private security force (unsure of how they’d legally define the service) I realized why I’d received hundreds of updates about supposed people with knives and suspected burglars for the last year. Because the app is selling fear, and the answer to fear, is their private security service. For a little cash and the tap of a finger, the afraid can bring a car to address whatever fear they’ve stoked into you. I don’t feel safer with helicopters swarming over my city day and night and I’ve never felt safer with patrol police officers zipping through my streets. This app, this “service”, cannot be trusted to manage a private patrol service for the terrified masses. People will, I believe, get hurt, or lose their dignity, sense of community, and humanity living in a world commodified by this shameful app. It’s sick, it doesn’t make us safer, or more informed. It’s a plague, beware!",3037,6481297c7a3b99eab485f74f
11,Noonlight: Feel Protected 24/7,"I use this all the time. Like when I am in a parking garage at night or anytime, driving for Uber or lift, some more sketchy like a neighborhood or something, or when I get off late from my career. I work as a registered nurse in the emergency room trauma care unit and you know you never get off when they tell you you’re going to get off so at times I have to walk to my car late at night or when I’m going to be walking in a parking garage, I always use this app literally for anything that I don’t feel safe for. you know if I’m at a gas station in a sketchy area or traveling, or you know checking into a hotel or going to a shop or something like that anytime I feel unsafe I use this app and they literally can be there within seconds. One time, I was the only one home and I was living with my grandparents at the time, they were on vacation, and I was house sitting. Our landing at the top of our very top floor stairs makes a creaking sound very distinctly when someone steps on it. So I held the button on the screen Until I was sure I was safe. Or so I thought. But then I kept hearing movements and such. So I hit the button, grabbed my gun, ran out of my house, back up to the top of the driveway in my care, turned my brights on so I could pretty much see through the whole house, and waited for the police force to show up. Literally 8 police where there in 3 minutes. Even ones from a different town 15 minutes away seemed like they made it instantly. But they were in my house for a long time searching through everything so I figured they didn’t find anything. And my grandma is very good friends with all the police officers as well as my grandpa and they pretty much raised three of them. And went to school and we’re best friends with two of them. So I was very comfortable with who I was dealing with. The police officers would do right by me and search every nook and cranny. Well, 15 minutes later maybe even 20, they come out with a huge man. The man was saying he had been watching me for a long time, he would be back to keep an eye on me, that he loved to watch me sleep, he was going to marry me one day and so many other crazy, Gory, and sexual things I won’t repeat. So long story short, theres still more to the story if you like to know it just ask but I will tell you that this app did save my life on this occasion as well as two other occasions. Seriously people, especially women, you need this app. As soon as you start to hold the button on the screen the police are waiting to get that call to come to you, you are being tracked, and they are waiting for you to let up off the button and not enter your code so they can rush to save you. They have your location at all times and they have your location even after you let go of that button like if something happened to where you let go of the button for some reason or whatever and they will come to you every single time with the quickness it is quicker than calling the police I promise. I give this app 1000000 stars.",3012,648136937a3b99eab48689f4
12,Noonlight: Feel Protected 24/7,"I am a 19 year old female who moved out a year ago & live alone; obviously I have some safety concerns. Even before living by myself, when I first got my license, I was always scared to be out by myself. I've had far too many instances where my safety felt compromised & my tactic before had always been to have 911 pre dialed so if need be I could hit call & be connected immediately, but of course there were many flaws to that plan (i.e. What if I drop my phone, what if they get ahold of it & hang up or answer & say oh I'm sorry my child was playing with my phone, what if I just don't have the chance to his call, how are they suppose to know where I am, who I am? etc. etc.) I carry pepper spray, I always carry my keys between my fingers (it's a defense technique where you use them as a weapon to stab/gouge your assailants eyes) I do everything I can to feel safer when I'm alone. Before purchasing this app I scrolled through the reviews to see why there were 1 or 2 star ratings where I found they all had one thing in common- the price. You are charged 2.99 per 1 month because they have their own personal call center to monitor the alerts through the app, these people have to be paid! & seriously people ""some of us can't afford the 2.99 even if it is for our safety."" But you can afford a smart phone? Probably a pack of gum here & there, maybe you grabbed a soda at the gas station this week, that .35 cents you got back in change when you bought groceries, & that .76 cents you got back when you paid for oil to put in your car - that adds up quickly! Put a little baggie in your car & throw you spare change in there & I guarantee you'll have your 2.99 by the end of the month to pay for the next month. Even buying ONE stupid thing like a candy bar, the brand name paper towels, the nicely scented hand soap, stuff like that, that you can do without, will be worth it when you could increase your safety & chances of surviving a dangerous & hostile situation because of the price of this app. Like I said, I am a 19 year old living on my own, I own my own car, I pay my own bills, I don't have Mommy & Daddy in my pocket, I make 10.50 an hour working 50 hours a week in a kitchen in a fine dining restaurant living in an income based apartment complex with rent, electricity, car insurance, a cell phone, paying for health insurance & any out of pocket expenses because I suffer from a chronic condition requires me to see a cardiologist every 3 months. I am a frugal, penny pinching, coupon loving, sales & clearance rack obsessor, I understand what it means when money is tight & you can't afford even the stupid little things. But honestly, I'll cancel my basic cable subscription or sleep in my car a couple nights to save money on gas for that 2.99 because what's the point of not spending that extra change so I can use it on something else when I end up being abducted & murdered because I didn't have this app to get help when I needed it so now I'm dead.... Saved 2.99 for nothing.",3011,648136937a3b99eab4868ac3
13,PulsePoint Respond,"Update for 3.2.2
Thanks for adding Incident Duration back to the screen. Helps to know which calls were major and which were either minor or false alarms. 

Update for 3.2.1
I like the look of the new icons and traffic directions will have to wait for an incident to support them. 
But i do not see the time on scene for the responders at all anymore. It used to be on call page so easy to tell what was important and what was a false alarm. Then they moved it to the icon so you had to click on each call. Now it is gone altogether. I know space was a factor before but that really does help to know if a fire call was critical and took 2 hours or just a burning pot on a stove and took 20 minutes. 

Update for version 3.12
Still works great.  Occasionally agencies will change their protocols or equipment and the app may not get all the calls right away, rare but does happen. Not the apps fault but they get it resolved quickly. 
Local agency recently upgraded their radios and that made it harder to pick up the tactical channels used by units on a call. Still not perfect but they are working on it. 

Update for 3.2.6  - 
Version 3.1.1 had occasional loss of agency but it was noted on their website with a work around until this fix came out. Have not had any other issues with losing settings and app continues to be very useful. Only thing I miss is on the Active/Recent calls page they took off the field about how long the call lasted. That helped to differentiate between False Alarm calls and calls that were important without having to click on each one individually. 

Update for 3.1.1. Talked to developer and settings seem to have stabilized now. New lower light bulb wattage on agency makes it easier to read unit status. Will need to test more as well. 

Update: 3.03. The settings to alert me when incidents happen keep getting wiped out every few days. No rhyme or reason as to why this happens. I have iPhone 5 with IOS 6.  Reducing to 2 Stars. Good app if it was more stable and they tweaked the color effects, see review below.  Version 2.x never did this.  If you have 2.x stay there until they resolve some of these issues. 

Update: 3.02 the notifications settings keep resetting to none and I have to keep turning them on.  Not sure why but it is annoying to keep checking on them. 
Also the flashlight look indicating the dept being monitored has a glare below it that makes the top incident hard to read. No reason to have it and should be removed. 

Original review:
Thanks for fixing the maps in v 3.01. Finally able to see the text again. 

I like the ability to easily switch between multiple agencies.

Found out my problem with broadcast button. It is a push button, not a sliding button. Push the picture of the microphone on the right of the slider and it turns on. Push again and it turns off. A little confusing since it looks like you should slide it to the right to turn it on. 
Giving it 5 stars with the new readable maps and now that I can hear again 

Thanks",3006,648137457a3b99eab486907d
14,Emergency Plus,"As a former emergency responder, I think ‘Emergency Plus’ is a fantastic idea, and I especially like that the application can automatically display one’s exact location using multiple methods, with varying degrees of accuracy.

The application does need a fair bit of work however.

Firstly, there is “critical” information deep within the menu that many people would not know are even there… For example, to find the ‘CPR guides’ and ‘fire alerts’, one must click the three lines in the top-left corner, followed by clicking ‘More Information’ and then finally, the drop-down arrow next to either ‘Royal Life Saving’ or ‘Fire Alerts’.

This is way too many steps to access “critical” information during an emergency and to be honest, most people probably wouldn’t even realise that they could find “critical” information like this deep in the menu.

It would also be nice to see ‘Apple Watch’ support integrated.

Just about everybody has an Apple Watch these days and adding support for these products would not only allow callers to use ‘Emergency Plus’ independently (i.e. when their smartphone is not physically with them), but it would also make the process of talking to emergency personnel easier (e.g. callers can refer to their Apple Watch for location information without needing to drop their smartphone away from their ear). Things like fire alerts could also be delivered to one’s Apple Watch product in real-time, even if their smartphone is not physically with them at the time.

I also don’t understand why there is no support for ‘Amber Alerts’ whatsoever.

I rarely know when ‘Amber Alerts’ have been issued, because I don’t listen to commercial radio or watch commercial television, and I don’t use social media, so the only time I know there’s an ‘Amber Alert’ active is if I just happen to drive past one of the dynamic road signs (i.e. the LED road signs that change)… If this application supported ‘Amber Alerts’ or better yet, supported ‘Amber Alerts’ AND ‘Apple Watch’ products, I could be notified in real-time whenever an ‘Amber Alert’ is active.

Another important feature which is lacking is support for notifications and by integrating such functionality, ‘Emergency Plus’ could deliver real-time notifications for Amber Alerts or emergencies (accidents, natural disasters, severe storms etc…) to anybody in the affected area… As with other (third-party) applications, users could optionally permit their location to be shared in the background, to fine-tune the delivery of such notifications.

‘Emergency Plus’ is an invaluable application to install on one’s smartphone, but it still has lots of rough edges and to be honest, it almost feels like a beta (“draft”) application… Whilst I’m sceptical, it would be nice to see this application updated to address these criticisms.",2810,64812b097a3b99eab48604bc
15,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"I had read one user complaining about the cost of this app not too long ago. I was like, lady you’re crazy! There is mos def a free version which I had been using on and off for sometime. Now, I say on and off because although the app can be helpful, informative and at times, entertaining (Mpls is home to multiple mischievous sword wielders, apparently)… but @ $19.99/mo once my free trial ends…?! Uhhhhh… no way! I must’ve been grandfathered in by having the app prior to there being a monthly fee to use this app… cuz after getting a new phone… Im now using a free trail but I jus cancelled my subscription to avoid the $19.99 auto charge looming in the near future. 

IMO, that is just WAYYYY too much to ask users to pay. Especially when it relies on us users to go live and report incidents as we see them. I mean, if you want our help providing the action…. Why would we pay you?! Lbs Also, it’s very easy to get wrapped up in this app. And because crime is def seeing an uptick in the Twin Cities… it was bringing ya girl down. And considerably, I was finding. It will do that to ya. ESPECIALLY if you allow notifications. I mean, lots of unpleasantness goin on around us… 24 hrs/day, 7 days per wk…. 365 days/yr. Sometimes youre in the mood for the realness…. a lot of times, it just gets too fkng heavy. So sometimes I gotta leave it alone for a while. I can’t use this app frequently enough to pay $20/mo. Mayyybe $5/mo. 

Another thing…. I’ve never felt like this app would/could serve me as a personal safety tool. Maybe I’m jus not out there like that, I guess. Perhaps it could be useful in that sense… but seems like a pretty big stretch. Especially because here in Mpls., all to often the incident locations are reported incorrectly. Very inaccurate actually… and next thing I know, I’ve wasted 15 min of my life wrapped up in the comments reading complaints about the app, the city, ppl debating fireworks or gunshots,  misinformation about all kinds of stuff…. Oh! And stupid ppl/perfect strangers talking smack with one another. Lame. It’s jus… not that great really—def not worth $20/mo. I’m not mad at the app… but I certainly will not be paying for it.  I’d pick it back up/participate when I have the mental/emotional capacity for it tho. Like tonight, accident right outside my house… high speed crash, 2 vehicles… in a 20mph zone. I felt the impact while standing in my kitchen. Then heard a woman yelling then same 3 cuss words over and over and over and over… for like ever. Could I have gone live right then and there…? Yup! Would it had made good footage…? Amazing. The two others posted by neighbors… not so much. I could hooked y’all up with some good content… but I thought bout that $20 price tag… and decided, nah.",2750,6481297c7a3b99eab485f84a
16,Hurricane: American Red Cross,"This app is an excellent one-stop resource for somebody going through their first hurricane or if they haven't gone through one for several years and need a quick reference or starting place. It has information for before, during, after, and ""Plan Ahead"" of a hurricane. Spot on advice about knowing the diff. between watches and warnings, don't waste time taping windows, and even lists for suggested supplies.

If used with Storm Radar and the Weather Channel's app you'll be a lot safer and more knowledgeable about hurricane preparedness and safety as well as getting important information at the literal tip of your finger. 

One thing I'd really like to see is addition of information for actually boarding up when preparing. 
- The most informative resource I found for boarding up once the news suggested we should was found after a long time searching online, no thanks to bad information out there. A lot of time which is essential before a hurricane was wasted searching and searching. What I did fine was poorly linked to on NOAA's site and even then seemed to go down or be deleted when I went back to reference it. Please add information on boarding as part of your information. Please?? Nothing super detailed. Just the suggested plywood thickness, what kind of sheet metals would do well as a substitute, how to attach it to your home, what kind of screws for what kind of surface, etc.

Actually in general please elaborate or expand on information that may not be expected to be a given to people who have already been through hurricanes. I remember my first time being in the crosshairs of a hurricane and finding detailed and explained information was hard there's so much out there and a lot of it bad. Everybody has short/simplified lists, but no details! Sometimes more than one sentence is needed to explain things. 

Other than being able to hide shelters locations on the map temporarily to better see the radar or map and adding more explanations or even videos to show a how-to (would be handy for boarding) I used this app as one of my hurricane go-to apps!! This for information and some alerts. I also used Storm Radar for the radar, alerts, detailed official warnings, and map that could show all kinds of warnings, alerts, and various details on the radar map. The official Weather Channel app for live tv feeds for in-person updates and meteorologist's opinions on what to expect.

Between this app, Storm Radar, and the live feed from the official Weather Channel app hurricane Irma didn't catch my unprepared and didn't give me any nasty surprises! I was certainly safer and I truly appreciate apps like this exist!! THANK YOU from a Floridian who used this app as part of their emergency kit!!",2730,64812def7a3b99eab4861897
17,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"This app could be huge. It could be a bedrock upon which to build very strong hyperlocal communities. Hyperlocal social networks if you will. 

Apps like nextdoor attempt this but they offer to do so much that it becomes lost in ads and spam so I Disconnected from that network. 

Citizen is potentially great because everyone cares deeply about crime in their immediate neighborhood. Sure, some people care a lot about all the crime happening in their entire city and want to know if 5 miles away there was an armed burglary - but this is dilutive. A lot of people just won’t care about such a geographical spread. So again, I emphasize this point: EVERYONE cares deeply about crime in THEIR IMMEDIATE neighborhood. And by immediate neighborhood I mean from a few blocks radius up to a quarter mile radius at most in a typical city. 

And therein lies Citizen’s greatest weakness and missed opportunity: it is poorly optimized for this hyper locality. Instead, it’s default setting is of a crime review of One’s entire city. The notifications pop up for locations distant and less important, like a shooting 10 miles away. Meanwhile, I miss notifications on the fire that happened two blocks away that is more meaningful to me. Even a package deliver stolen off of someone’s porch three houses away would be 100x more valuable info to me than a murder 10 miles away. 

Once you get hyperlocality going, more neighbors would participate. With more participate, more dialogue, more helpful submissions. I care less to help my fellow New Yorker 10 miles away than my neighbors around me with relevant information. It’s not that I don’t care at all, just much less. If hyperlocality could be achieved, a true vibrant social network and platform could be created, one that I would fully engage and participate in. 

But alas this app is not that. While you can zoom in and see what’s going on near you manually, the app itself from landing screen to notifications etc are all optimized for entire city experience. Its not personal or intimate at all but just another big anatomous social network platform aspirant. 

They have got one half the equation right: people care deeply about the crime around them. But they got the definition of “around them” all wrong. 

So long as they stay macro-local, this app offers minimal value and I will be deleting it. 

Hopefully one day a developer gets it right and creates a true hyper local crime app optimized from the start to connect only those you say hello to in the mornings and evenings.",2533,6481297c7a3b99eab485f739
18,Storm Shield ,This app has become the app I use only for notifications now I no longer use it for the radar or anything else and lately I haven’t been getting notifications and very soon this app is going to be removed from my phone because one their are features that cost money for a monthly subscription fee and I am not going to pay for a monthly subscription for an app I bought 4 years ago when I can get other weather apps that have the same features for no additional cost that come with the app and they are free apps I get it those are just added on features but it’s not fair to charge for the additional added features that you developers included in this app when other weather app developers aren’t even charging for those features and here I spent $5.00 on this app 4 years ago I just don’t think it’s right or fair for you developers to be charging monthly subscriptions for features like future cast or both or even lightning tracker when I can name 4 apps that don’t even charge for those features and soon this app is going to be removed from my iPhone XR because the notification feature doesn’t even work anymore so there is no reason this app should be taking up storage on my iPhone XR when it has additional added on features that I will have to pay a monthly subscription for and this was a good app while it lasted but now unfortunately all good things have to come to a end but you can easily get me back I did enjoy the radar map lay out its just being charged a monthly subscription fee for getting additional features like future cast or both future cast and the current weather conditions and this also includes the additional cost of lighting tracker if you stop charging for those features you can easily get me back again I just would prefer to use apps that have those features I mentioned at no additional cost and are free to use and not a weather app that charges a monthly subscription for those features I’m not mad and I’m not complaining I’m just very disappointed 😔 that a good app that I use to enjoy charges for those features but again you can get me back just don’t charge for features that other weather app developers aren’t even charging for but do what you want with your app it’s your app but my review has gone down from a 5 star rating to a 1 star rating I will update my review in the near future once those features that other weather apps have are included in your app for no additional cost I just don’t think it’s fair that you developers are doing this to your loyal customers.,2523,648138137a3b99eab4869e33
19,AccuWeather: Weather Alerts & Live Storm Radar,"User friendly, freezes up occasionally on my Android newer LG cell phone through Boost Mobile. Before updating with all eye candy buttons, It  gave precise locations, & easy access to information using the touch screen with other apps but this time with the newer Accu Weather version it doesn't. Even when entering a FL local where some of my relatives live wouldn't even show a wide map shot of any Hurricane information on my map. Now, I've been trying to track cloud formations from Irma where I live in IL. & not showing anything. I'm still not getting rain cloud formation, though the other weather news shows & channels are showing it where it's heading. it's there on other Radars but not Accu Weather Map on my LG Ph. It  won't show the clouds moving up towards the southern part of IL. There's times when accessing the map part on the Android App, the Doplar Radar doesn't show nothing. In times of peperation the radar shows nothing. No rain clouds from Irma on the Southern part of IL. I feel this App doesn't generate the information quickly enough & the important information until it's on top of us which is very scary due to the lag of information that's to be generated for preparedness.  This definitely needs to be worked on for quicker intel & displays on mapping updates. Leaving people in the dark basically states to me the uncaring of life for those who are disabled, such as myself. With a Severe Spinal Disease I can say this App is in very short disappointing compared to when everything worked. New doesn't mean it's necessarily good. In Accu Weathers Android App, it's terrible to get quick dependable information, especially on the Map part. There's many words that I can say but they wouldn't be appropriate. Fix the quick intel & widen the map intel for people so prepardness can be early enough before people die because of lack of a widening map display of cloud formations. Heck, checking on friends & family after putting in their local didn't even show the rain clouds in the dopplar but when clicking on ckoud formation from the satellite view shown the huge Irma Hurricane hitting FL.? Please,  fix this because people need quick intel & Rain formation in the dopplar. I can say I don't believe the time frames this app is showing, nor the rain dopplar doesn't work. I get a T-Storms or Tornado warnings but when checking Rain Dopplar, nothing shows. Even when using my Wifi or when widening Ariel view of the whole state it will not show any rain clouds.",2494,64809e2eb0217b8b85c1078e
20,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"I have an issue with the support team. They do not give you a chance to state your case by submitting a request to them. They ignore the request and keep you in limbo. Since they have control, they will automatically blacklist you and treat you adversely. The citizen support team is likely to be made up of a couple of computer geeks or grass-root liberals from the city who deal with issues occurring with there app. I believe they sit behind a computer and if you piss a support team member off, they hold there ears shut and capitalize on controlling your status. I had a screen name ”Creampie” for a long time. I have been in chats on there and was never called out or warned for improper use or violating terms. 
I posted my view a couple of weeks ago and they permanently changed my name to punish me because someone was sensitive to my screen name “Creampie” I was afforded once to change it and I never got a reason why it needed to be changed since creampie is not derogatory. It’s not a curse. It is something you eat. Just like banana creampie. By trade my business is making creampie and I sell it daily. So I am assuming a snowflake that works for citizenapp has sensitive ears or doesn’t like creampie. It’s ok. But my suggestion is to try it because you will will feel it’s a delicious delicacy. 
    So my issue is that they reverted my screen name to some generic user1557857457 and I would like the opportunity to change it to something that is not going to hurt someone’s feelings. I apologize to the support member for them being hurt by the word “creampie”. I do have to say that they should be monitoring vigilantly the chats because I see worst stuff written such as racially charged words and people cursing as well as deviant ideas. I feel that the app is geared for the low class typical, have my handout, millennial liberal thug from the projects, to sensationalize and get there 15 minutes of fame. 
   In conclusion, i have submitted a request on the above names and asking for you to lift the restriction. I will change it to a name that will not be adversarial in your eyes. But as advice to the support team, I suggest that you shouldn’t throw stones at glass houses and host the people writing in the chat rooms possibly violent utterances or curses or ghetto gang language. I do not recommend this app to chat with the people on there. You maybe hurting someones feelings.",2407,6481297c7a3b99eab485f8d9
21,Storm Shield ,"I’ve had the app for well over 5 years so I think I have been using this app long enough to make a detailed review.

First, I think this is one of the better apps out there compared to the competitors, especially in the last couple years due to the fact that it has remained mostly the same with maybe some minor updates here and there.

The biggest thing that I don’t like about the app is the fact that the radar only updates in 15 minute intervals. Most other competitors have the radar updating every 5 minutes. This poses an issue because storms in my area move incredibly fast so updates every 15 minutes simply isn’t enough to make accurate predictions of where the storm is headed. It also makes the radar look more “choppy” compared to the competitors. I understand that weather data is incredibly expensive but there must be a workaround in order to get more recent updates.

There are a couple other issues with the radar that I have noticed throughout the years. One of the issues is that sometimes it takes multiple seconds for the radar to animate when you press the play button on the radar screen. This is just a mild inconvenience and isn’t too much of an issue. It also typically occurs when you either zoom in or out on the map. Sometimes it is better to reload the app in order to get it to respond faster. 

I also have a couple suggestions for improvement of the app for future developments:

1) There should be an option to load the full screen radar view when launching the app instead of the app launching with the “current location” box at the bottom of the screen 

2) I would personally like it if there were some more colors on the details screen when looking at your daily outlook and other information. Something to catch your eye more like some of the other apps

3) It would be nice if there was an IOS widget that you could put on your phone that would show a picture of what the current radar looks like.

4) Lastly, it would be nice if there were more details shown in the daily weather outlook as it seems very lackluster right now. It should be more detailed with current forecast for the day as well as the forecast for the night as well, similar to most other apps.

Other than those few minor issues, I still think this app is very good, but it definitely could be better than what it is. The potential is there.",2353,648138137a3b99eab4869860
22,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"I live in a very high fire danger area in California
No other method of Early Warning comes close to Citizen
Time is everything in a fire that can move many football fields per minute. We don’t have time for an official to be woken in the middle of the night and to decide when to send out a warning, 
This APP puts early warnings in your and my hands.

If I see a fire in the hills I can video it, while at the same time Citizen verifies  it before they Post it and send Texts it to all my neighbors and family in the area who have the APP.

I have my immediate family and a few neighbors in my friends list that have approved me to see their locations, if I am away or at work in a nearby city and there is a fire I can pull out the APP and see where they are on the map. I can see at a glance If they have evacuated or not, where they went, or if I need to call them or bang on their doors,  to get out of harms way if they somehow missed the texts.

We are signed up to receive all the County and City Fire emergency service warnings.  But none of them have sent out a alert for nearby fires yet in my area. Only Citizen and the subscribers have consistently been on top of early warnings. We have had about 5 in the last 2 years that I had to watch and only Citizen warned me there was a fire 900 feet from my house etc.

My home burnt in the 1991 Oakland Fire storm and we had 10 minutes to get out. We had no idea the fire was on top of us. We who survived the firestorms are acutely aware of what this APP is capable of to save our lives. My neighborhood has a very high density of users. Both Young and old.

Citizen keep adding features. Recently they gave us the ability to turn on or off the type of messages we see. There are currently three cartagories. Covid, Helicopter, and then all the rest.
I have helicopters enabled as that is another indicator of a fire in our hills.

I love this APP as it gives me peace of mind that a neigbor will send Citizen an alert of fire danger. And I will be warned in minutes.a photo is worth a thousand words, a video is worth a million. I can see the size of the fire and where it is and act accordingly.

I also watch crime trends in my area. So that I can minimize my exposure. I like to be proactive. And the crime activity informs me where I need to beef up my security.
Yes I love this APP",2346,6481297c7a3b99eab485f56c
23,Noonlight: Feel Protected 24/7,"Last night I had a situation where my phone had fallen off my nightstand and it must’ve been on silent... when all of a sudden there was banging outside of my house at the front door at 1:30 in the morning! I opened the front door where my dogs were barking crazily and to my surprise seven cops and four cop cars were outside my house with the lights on! As I rubbed my eyes and ask the officers if there was a problem, the officer said yes we’re looking for (and they stated my name) she called for assistance... I told them there must be some mistake, I am her and I didn’t call 911… They kindly asked me for ID which they show them and they asked me to check my phone… I saw the distress signal from safe track and I remembered my phone falling off the night table and as I picked it up I must’ve hit the button by accident which is on my home screen just in case I was ever in a situation, and as I put it up back to the top of my night table I must’ve pressed the button and since my phone was on silent, I never heard them text or called me but it was definitely reassuring to know that they had dispatched the help that I had needed God for bid anything was in a serious matter! Safe track is a wonderful application to have it is a must have for all women and children in all areas to feel safe! I would highly HIGHLY Recommend every father brother grandfather or uncle boyfriend to insist that their sister daughter mother girlfriend goddaughter download and pay the small fee every month to have this application on their phone just for that peace of mind to know that their loved one will always always ALWAYS Be safe with their handheld guardian angel and know that they will be safe with the seven minute that will bust down their door or be at their location with in minutes to save their lives if God for bid anything were to be there to harm them! Those men that were at my door last night to save my life if anything should happen to me I felt safe, thank you safe track or noon light or whoever you are thank you for being there for me last night and every day of my life! You guys are the true heroes sending out people every night… Or should I say sending out those angels every night to save those people thank you for everything you do! We thank you everyone of us!",2288,648136937a3b99eab486766d
24,Hurricane Tracker,"Being in Southern Florida, tropical storms are a concern June to November, and even outside of these occasionally... I've tried several weather apps, both paid and free, and many have their own features, but Hurricane Tracker has everything, all the info from NOAA and the National Hurricane Center, plus some screens I don't know where they came from... Because of this app, no more waiting for 3, 6 & 12 hour reports on local news, when a storm is active these folks have us all tapped in to whatever the NHC has at the moment, all in one place. They got all the latest satellite images, radar and loops, projected paths from the same computers that run the different models, all the text releases. It's certainly possible to get these on your own (which I used to do), but everything's here!... In times past it was a problem with the bandwidth, but since service has got better it makes even more sense. So if you find yourself frustrated waiting on the local news to get the latest about an approaching storm, I recommend Hurricane Tracker. You can even get access from their website too, if you want to see larger versions of satellite and radar. I went through Andrew, plus every other storm down here since Camille, and after searching, this is the best app I could find for this purpose.
Update 9/08/2021 - I wanted to include a note about the available upgrade, for more “In Depth” information, this is a product that can give a better understanding of wind speeds that are possible on a map, something the hurricane center does not do, and also has a few maps that are unique to Hurricane Tracker. I’ve been using the upgrade now over a couple of seasons, and what they give is about as close to forecasting as can be with claiming to be clairvoyant! The Hurricane center shows you a dot where the center of the storm is forecast to traverse, but there is actually more information, such as certain wind fields that may cross over the same areas (tropical storm, hurricane, hurricane 2, etc.) and Hurricane Tracker loads this into one map, and that is only one of the additional products offered in the package. Trust me, worth the extra cost, and I STILL have not seen a better app for tracking tropical cyclones than Hurricane Tracker, paid or not!",2261,64812d927a3b99eab486181b
25,Noonlight: Feel Protected 24/7,"I downloaded this app to try just because it was a good idea to have. Little did I know I would actually find out how it works and realize just how important it is for EVERY individual. I’d had it on my phone for about a couple of weeks I think when one afternoon I was going into the kitchen, phone and a small stylus in my pants front pocket because my hands were full at the time. I’d emptied my hands/arms of the stuff in the kitchen and had walked into the living room when I felt my phone vibrating in my pocket. It took a minute to get the phone out and then put my reading glasses on but I could see the screen glowing red and wondered what it was doing. Luckily just as I was able to get my glasses on, that’s when I started receiving text messages and as I read the first I saw that the Noonlight app had been activated and it was their agent texting me to see if I needed help and reminding me to enter my PIN number to cancel the alert if it had not been needed. I quickly texted my PIN but already my phone was ringing with an agent so I informed her that it had accidentally been pushed and that I was fine. She thanked me and canceled the alert request. She also told me that had I not answered their calls then Emergency Services would have immediately been notified and sent on their way by GPS location. All at once I was 1. Very happy and relieved that I would have had help coming if it had been a real life emergency, 2. Kind of in shock that the app actually worked and suddenly aware of the seriousness of the situation, and 3. Impressed and now determined to spread the word of how important this app is to have regardless of age, gender, location, or health status!! Every woman, man, child, parent, friend, relative, coworker, chronic illness patient, mental illness patient, etc no matter the age should have this on their phone. The app is free but you have options to subscribe for additional different services such as Apple Watch and Vehicle Impact Emergencies to name only two. I’m definitely going to make this app a permanent, easily accessible feature on my phone and am planning to add more features through subscription. If you don’t already have it please get it, if only for the free version. I’m a customer for life now!",2260,648136937a3b99eab486777e

29,Noonlight: Feel Protected 24/7,"So I’m 22 as a college senior. I wish this app was free cause currently, I have no profit to afford this app cause I’m desperately looking for a job and it’s difficult. I’m saving money for my monthly bills, college books, and food. There’s nothing I can do to afford paying this monthly subscription, I’m not going to starve myself to pay for this app and I don’t even spend money on unnecessary stuff. Now this app would be so useful for me cause as a female college student, there are times where I could be in an unsafe situation. One time I went to my college gym during the day and men were staring at me and I was feeling unsafe. Sometimes I stay late at my college campus to study with friends, I feel unsafe walking from the library to the parking garage outside in the dark. Another time was when there was a campus alert of a brown bear roaming on campus at 10pm when I was walking to my dorm, another time there was a gas station robbery and the criminals went to my college campus and even went to the parking garage where I park my car and then the campus alerted students that they could be hiding anywhere on campus, which I felt super unsafe with my heart beating fast almost having a panic attack. During the summer I am home but when I walk my corgi in the afternoon, people in my neighborhood hire all these lawn and house workers that look so super sketchy and look like they could just kidnap me to where I avoid them. Sometimes when I walk to my car from a public place, I get catcalls from dudes driving their trucks. THESE ARE ALL SITUATIONS WHERE I COULD USE A SAFETY APP TO MAKE ME FEEL SAFE BUT APPARENTLY THIS IS THE ONLY APP THAT OFFERS THAT EXCEPT IT ISNT FREE. Sorry for being offensive. Sure yeah there’s the safety feature on my iphone, but it isn’t immediate and it’s not like you can call off the police to say everything is okay now. In a couple months, I’m about to pick up my friend from the airport from the waiting area and I would prefer to have something to make me feel safe to where I can have peace of mind while waiting for my friend in the pickup area where there is a lot of people to where I could get snatched. Yeah sure nothing is free but financially-struggling college students exist too.",2242,648136937a3b99eab4867fe8
30,Noonlight: Feel Protected 24/7,"This app is the best. I would give it more stars if there were any. I am a Real Estate Agent here in California. I got this app after another agent and I had an altercation when a gentlemen strolled into our office. Lucky there was another agent to call the police. Agent's are always vulnerable while conducting open houses, and showings. I love the way I can use this app without anyone even noticing, as it looks like I'm just holding my phone. This app is so fast. You just put your thumb on the blue sheild. If for any reason your thumb disingadges, you have 10 secs to put your code in. While showing someone else how it works. I forgot my code. Next thing I knew there was a text asking if I was ok. Before I could respond, I received a call. Even though it was a false alarm, the customer agent was so relieved to know I was safe, instead of being angry for a false alarm. If I had not responded to the call, they would have called the police. This happened to me in Hawaii while attending a wedding. My phone got so low on battery, my screen went black. I thought it had shut down. But, I must have activated the shield while putting it away in my purse. Because, the next thing I knew, there were 7 police officers asking for me. It took a lot of convincing that I was fine. They were not pleased to say the least. I explained how it worked and told them how shocked i was that the app had worked at all, since I was from California. A whole ocean apart. Amazing!! Even more amazing was the follow up I got 2 days later on Monday from one of the co-founders of this app. Texting me to make sure I was fine. Even though it was a very embarrassing situation, I apologized for creating such a stir. He reassured me that this is what this app is all about. Your safety first. They would rather have a false alarm, than the unthinkable happen to anyone. He told me although it was created for college students, Agents like myself are finding it an essential tool, too. And that no matter where you are, they are only 10 seconds away. I believe everyone should have it on their phone, tablet, whatever electronics it can be downloaded onto. It's unobtrusive, but very effective. 2.99 is worth the peace mind.",2212,64809622991eb46aaf1114da

33,KATWARN,"Ich finde die App wirklich sehr gut. Aber: Leider zeigte sich nach dem Amoklauf von München, dass das System selbst bei ""kleinen"" Problemen* nicht dazu in der Lage ist, rechtzeitig zu warnen. Die Meldung der Stadt/des Landes kam sehr spät! (Besteht die Möglichkeit, Warnungen anderer Quellen einzubauen? z.B.: Moderatoren, Administratoren oder Nutzer direkt?) Dann waren die Meldungen noch nicht mal mehr zu öffnen, da es Serverüberlastungen gab. Doch wie soll das dann erst bei großen, humanitären Katastrophen sein, die sich über mehr als eine Stadt ziehen?

Verbesserungsvorschläge:

- Server ausbauen. (Wisst ihr selber denke ich.)

-Das Klicken auf das Kartensymbol oben rechts finde ich unnötig. Lässt es sich nicht so einrichten, dass man ohne einen Wechsel der Kartenansicht zu anderen Städten rauszoomen kann?

-Verschiedene Benachrichtigungstöne. Ich empfinde den Standart-Ton als sehr unangenehm. Bin dazu geneigt, ihn auszuschalten. (Siehe/Höre die Auswahl an Tönen bei der NINA-App)
Das wäre auch leicht zu implementieren. Bitte dann aber auch die Möglichkeit einbauen, für verschiedene, eingespeicherte Orte andere/keine Töne einzustellen!

-IFTTT-Kompatibilität, um zB: Smarte Hausgeräte aus- oder umzustellen. Nützlich sind dabei vor allem die möglichen Verknüpfungen mit Smarten Beleuchtungssystemen (zB: Phillips Hue), diese können eine Warnung über einen Farbwechsel oder durch Blinken zusätzlich optisch verstärken. 
Oder eben akustisch durch verknüpfte Alarmanlagen/Rauchmelder.

- Wie sieht es eig. mit Warnungen für Grenzregionen aus?  z.B.: Französische AKW's 
Ist es für diese Orte nicht sinnvoll, die Meldungen angrenzender Staaten auch anzuzeigen?

Ich persönlich denke, das Sirenennetz kann man so nicht ersetzen. Aber wenigstens Ergänzen. Dann sollte aber auch beides intakt funktionieren: Nicht überall gibt's Sirenen; Die App-Systeme sind auch nicht zuverlässig und werdens auch nie sein: Kein Handy dabei; Kein Netz; Akku leer = Keine Warnung. Aber dafü kann die App ja nix ;)

34,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"To the creators of Citizen;

The two things the citizen app has taught me is that 1. there are more people with swords living in San Francisco than in game of thrones, and 2. it's the most remarkable app that no ones ever heard of.

I heard about Citizen while sitting in an uber. There was a traffic jam and as far as we could see, a cavalcade of armed cops were transfixed on what seemed to be a crime thwarted, and as the police carried out their civic duty, a flurry of citizens were armed not with guns or tasers as their blue suit civil servant counterparts, but armed with their phones, uploading photos to Citizen. I realized then if every Berkeley college student were armed with Citizen, it could have helped with the pepper spray attacks from Berkeley police officers run amuck. It could help every missing black youth whose their disappearance goes underreported by local media due to the color of their skin. It could help bring light to immigration raids, it can be a tool of oppressed people everywhere and I wonder if an app like citizen existed in Dr. King's time, would he have mentioned it as the number 1 defense against injustice, whether by criminals or law enforcement? To me at the time I heard of this app, I imagined it must be one of the most popular apps in the App Store and tons of articles must have been written about it. Then I googled it, and the first thing that popped up was the piece done by tech crunch. Granted it was a hit job but it made me frustrated to see such a genius app berated as well as marketed so poorly. I'm not a techie. I don't live in the bubble of the tech world where everyone high fives eachother for theories, good ideas and vc money. I'm a regular guy, a 9 time award winning indie film director and a minority. I'm sure many of your black and Latino engineers probably mentioned just like myself the great potential this app has to protect the oppressed and underprivileged. I feel strongly about the good that an app like yours can do and I'll be sending you an email to further discuss the pioneering strides you all are making at citizen. Thank you for trying to make the world a safer place.",2158,6481297c7a3b99eab485f34b
35,Noonlight: Feel Protected 24/7,"I’ve been desperate for help this personal,fast, and easy! The last two months I’ve had someone(s) be able to almost completely open 3 of my windows and all but get thru my front door had if not been for the extra chain I installed. Wooden dowels in the window wells didn’t faze them. They’ve sprayed something on my lawn to make crazy designs and my dog was poisoned by it and it’s a miracle she pulled thru. My shed has been destroyed, property items stolen… random whistling outside my window at night. I’ve installed motion lights that they turned off. I’ve installed sensors alarms on all my windows and security bars for my doors. But, regardless they keep on. I’ve called 911 and the non emergency dispatch many times to report these things but because they don’t catch anyone on my property (it takes them average 45 min to get here in town) and my walls are thin so they know when I call so of course they don’t wait around for the police! Point is, the police have been taking long and longer to respond to my calls even on slow nights… they dismiss me and don’t seem to think I’m in a lot of danger!!! I’ve felt so alone and with living alone as a single woman, and all the nights I’d hear them start to come inside I’d struggle between my phone and calling 911, grabbing my pepper spray and dog and moving quickly to leave. In a moment like that your brain and body panic. Well, now all I have to do is hold down the button when I think I hear something. I hold it till I’m able to dismiss it as nothing or take my finger off the screen and help is coming!! If it’s a false alarm I enter my pin to cancel… but even after that you recieve a real text message from a real person telling you they’re glad you’re safe but if you feel scared again then use the button again! I cannot tell you how this has helped me regain a lot of my power and confidence that I’ll be ok… it’s been made so easy! Trust me, dialing 911 doesn’t seem like it would take time or be difficult- but in an emergency microseconds count! I don’t have to wait alone terrified for over 45 min for the police! No woman should! Thank God for this app, im sooooooo grateful!!!!",2154,648136937a3b99eab48673ab
36,Hurricane Tracker,"I am back at college in Miami, also known as ""the Hurricanes"", for good reason, my home is Jupiter Island. So It is very important for me to keep track of hurricanes. I have tried more than a dozen other apps, this one is the most informative, yet very easy to use, and accurate as most of the info comes from NOAA. Look no further, this is the best on the app store. If you live in a hurricane prone area like South FL. You have to DL this.

UPDATE regarding Isaac; worked flawlessly throughout T.S./hurricane Isaac, I was in Miami,I wasn't connected to Wi-Fi however I have read reviews where people say they experienced problems. There was one review that said they had 4G but still experienced problems, there is no iPhone including the 4S that supports 4G. Despite commercials that cleverly make it sound like they do by choosing their words very carefully, the iPhone 4S does support 4G, regardless of your carrier your iPhone does not support 4G, if you think Im wrong google ""does the Iphone 4S support 4G""claiming that it does either makes you a liar or it means you don't know what you are talking about. Yes, the current IPad DOES support 4G, but, IPhones don't, google it. There is a way that some carriers make 3G faster, but it is still 3G(see HSPA+).My final two points if you consider this app hard to use then you're not very good with technology, just by looking at one map, the 3/5 day cone, if you look at the bottom part of just that one map it has its exact location at the time, along with current wind speeds, it even shows where a TS is predicted to become a hurricane, if you experienced any problems during the storm it is your carriers fault because their towers were unable to handle the additional bandwidth, so they cut speeds down, that is why I have Verizon works great all the time, almost everywhere. If you have a 4 or 4S make sure sufficient RAM is free by seeing the apps running in the background by double clicking the home button. it seems that for every good app there is a few who give it one star want their money back even though it was their fault, not the app.

37,SoSecure: Personal Safety. Live Emergency Response,"Going from ADT Go to SoSecure is like quitting a 6-figure salary occupation so you can apply for a minimum wage job at temp agency that may not even get because their are more qualified applicants.

For the everyday person, SoSecure provides a service for very seldom occurring situations (what-if emergencies), where ADT Go provided services for EVERYDAY situations (e.g., arriving at home, work, school, after-school safe places, etc.).  ADT Go allowed you to pinpoint specific places of security and/or needed/desired destinations AND receive notification that an arrival or departure has been made.  The gps details like speed/mph helped you monitor unsafe driving habits of minors (AND adults transporting minors).  THAT in itself gave you the security that is desired.  Being that my wife was in an accident, the Crash Detection was paramount in spontaneous decision making.

SoSecure has NONE of that.  You list up to five contacts as a “Guardian” and THAT’S IT. They don’t even know of any activity until you PAY for the app’s ONLY feature: TrackMe.  TrackMe is not practical either.  The only way TrackMe would be effective is if one were to set a TIMER based (🤷🏾‍♂️) activity event.  In real time, NO ONE is consciously thinking, “Let me set a timer for all of my scheduled and non-scheduled movements today.  Oh, and let me do that for my spouse and children as well.”  No!  People are on the GO (ADT Go pun intended)!  The real time, intermittent notifications provided by ADT Go were what was and IS needed/desired.

Lastly, why the nickel-and-diming?!?!?!  Your customers pay for installations and annual, semi-annual, and monthly premiums for your home security and monitor services.  Why not re-initiate ADT Go and simply add SoSecure’s SOS and TrackMe as additional ADT Go features, then make everything within the app FREE?!  That would be a major attraction (AND selling point) for new customers.  Making your complementary apps’ services subscription-based when customers are already subscribing to your primary services pushes away your current loyal customers.",2082,6481377e7a3b99eab48694f7
38,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"This app is really nice and at first I thought they would put fake scenarios out there but recently when there was a guy waving a gun around by my block I saw 10+ police cars out and searching on my way home even questioning me. I agree with one of the reviews on how he wishes how we can pick the alerts and distances and how some of his was unnecessary buy all of mine were serious but I do like it Brighton beach what do you expect. I'm just curious what their sources are like have they teamed up with the NYPD. And I do love the fact the users are there before the news even if the news were there they would never go live instantly or release footage or information out to the public. The app is at a great start and in NYC where there's crime under our noses this is very useful and with updates and time to time maintenance I think this app will be on every NYC residents phone. I also do wish there was a way to report your own crime either instantly with them contacting the police or minor things that can be  filled out more detailed. Other then that great app I recommend it to everyone. Its also fun I've been going through this more then my social media because it's very interesting and useful information all the time. Keep it up
 
I'm edition to my original review I think they should keep past alerts up to a week at least if not within a couple of years the whole NYC map would be red dots and you wouldn't to be able to find anything 
Second of all they should have 3 categories one should be major events one should be the top closest 3 rd should be trending I guess so cause it’s already and I feel like the list should be at least 3 times longer and especially listed closest to furthest because half of the things happening I see are 15+ miles I think the closest should me more important and if I wanna go somewhere I’ll check I’m the map anyways but I don’t want to go through the map because half the time the more you zoom in or out or you move the map some of the red dots appear or disappear but like I said with mothly updates they do good",2071,6481297c7a3b99eab485f23b
39,SD Emergency,"The concept and thought is a good idea however this app is poorly implemented leading to a serious risk to a loss of life.

Read full review for all details:

First off most importantly key information sections are obtained from ""official sources"" and then compiled for release, a process that can take several hours. This is a warning that is given if you dig deep into where ""app"" gets its information but is shown nowhere in the app itself. 

Which brings up the first real problem,
This app it's not really an app it's just a lot of bookmarked websites (city twitter feeds, links to SDEmergency website, etc) that show up inside the app. This sounds like this makes it a good thing however the fact it is relying on existing websites makes the display of information subject to website faults.

Emergency Map unusable:
The Emergency map is virtually unusable, it's an inline display of the map on the SDEmergency website. The website appears to not intended to be mobile friendly. Clicking an info box inside the app results in a ""pop up"" that shows outside the visible portion of the screen. If I used Safari I could force scroll around to see the info but not inside the app. Most critically however this space specifically has a warning on the SDEmergency website that the map can take several hours to update, this is not displayed anywhere on the app leading to a lack of situational awareness. 

Do not rely on this map for realtime evacuation and road closure information !!!

Links to information from each region is equally plaugued with faults and risks, being inline web pages you have all webpage faults it's better to open these pages in Safari or native app (like twitter) where you can subscribe to the info and get realtime alerts.

Your best best is to bookmark your normal information sources or if you really want to know what's going on do like me and find a HAM radio op in your neighborhood and remain on friendly terms with them as HAM is the best information source I've seen in disasters.",2017,648137567a3b99eab48693ff
40,KATWARN,"Vermutlich dürfte die Zahl der Nutzer sehr überschaubar sein. Die App ist ein weiterer Versuch zusätzliche Software auf den Smartphones - vorbei an bestehenden Standards - auf die Endgeräte der Nutzer zu bekommen. Obwohl es längst Protokolle / Schnittstellen für Katastrophenwarnungen gibt, wird man hier auf eine Insel manövriert.

- Kein Mensch weiß wie valide und aktuell die Daten sind. Die Quelle der Daten muss deutlicher hervorgehen und Kontaktdaten für Rückfragen sind anzugeben. 

- Bei der Havarie vor Borkum wurde bspw. vor Containern mit Gefahrenstoffen gewarnt aber nicht angegeben, um welche es sich tatsächlich handelt. Informationsmehrwert gegenüber Google News = null. 

- Warum nicht auch die PKS als Kriminalitäts-Brennpunkt-Zonen mit einfließen lassen? Es gibt ja polizeiliche Allgemeinverfügungen die bestimmte Orte zu bestimmen Zeiten quasi zu „No-Go-Areas“ klassifizieren. Wo bspw. „gefährliche Werkzeuge“ (Bleistifte? Pfefferspray bei Frauen?) zu horrenden Zwangsgeldern führen können. Woher soll man das vorher wissen???

- Eine Übersichtskarte gibt es nicht. Man muss sich schon auf seine eigene Auswahl an Orten beschränken. Wer also seine Reise plant, hat wieder zusätzliche Arbeit, sofern er nicht fortwährend seinen Standort freigeben möchte. 

Der allgemeine Mehrwert ist nicht unbedingt überzeugend, weil die App einen sehr beschränkten Funktionsumfang besitzt. Wenn es zur „Katastrophe“ kommt, verlasse ich mich doch lieber auf meine Menschenkenntnis und Umgebungs-Wahrnehmung. Die Züge der DB fallen ja bereits bei einem lauen Lüftchen oder falscher Planung oft genug aus, so dass ich mir als Bahnfahrer die Infos schon aus Zugverspätungen herleiten kann ;) 

Macht es wie in den USA und löst doch mal direkt eine Massenpanik auf Hawaii wegen eines Atomkriegs aus. Dann fällt ehh der Mobilfunk für die nächste Stunde aus und das Smartphone ist dann ehh nur noch ein teurer Briefbeschwerer. Rückfallebenen um das zu vermeiden sehe ich hier nicht.

41,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"Holy cow, this app is toxic as can be, and that’s coming from using NextDoor.  On almost every major incident around me, there are comments that are either spouting “kill the cops”, the “n” word, or other racist or discriminatory propaganda with no moderation whatsoever.  I find it funny that their fancy streamed media with a “reporter” from Citizen talking about a large scale incident they get moderation, but it is literally absent every other time.  Deleting the app and letting my company know to do the same on the unit phones.  By the way, I live in a busy suburb in the 5th largest city in the U.S., this app has not helped me avoid danger once.  It has reported incidents dozens of miles away, in directions and neighborhoods I never travel near, but has never spared me running up on an accident scene or driving by some pretty dangerous situations.  It literally fails to do the one thing it claims to.  It is only something for the karens to watch and gawk about.

I get spammed all through the night about incidents that happen well over 10 miles away from me, on the other side of the metropolitan area. While these are significant events such as shootings and violent crime, they’re in areas I never travel to or through. There needs to be some way to sort incidents to within a set distance around you. Within 5 miles would be perfect for both my home and workplace, but above that is just spamming my phone and wasting space on the screen when closer, more relevant incidents that may be lower acuity are taking place. Additionally, this seems to take drivers’ eyes off of the road to report incidents rather than focusing on driving. While I know this is more on the end user, I don’t feel that Citizen should allow reporting while moving over a certain speed limit. There are already too many distractions on the road to worry about, I don’t want to be an incident reported on Citizen when I am run over by another user trying to record the incident I’m responding to with an ambulance.",2007,6481297c7a3b99eab485f5ff
42,Noonlight: Feel Protected 24/7,"i was unsure about this when i first got it since i'd never actually used it and seen how it worked in real time. it was just spoken very highly of, so i figured it wouldn't hurt just to have on my phone. i've actually had the app for a while and decided to review now because earlier this night, i accidentally hit the panic button because i didn't realize my phone screen was still on in my pocket. 

i was looking through receipts after the exchange that happened, but to make it short, they had help at my doorstep in less than ten minutes. i didn't see until afterwards, but a provider had texted, then called three times before notifying my local police. my watch was dead and my phone was on sleep mode so i didn't receive the texts/calls. i managed to answer when i got a call from my local police department & i was told that they had officers outside of my house RIGHT THEN. 

what followed was police protocol, i met the officer outside, apologized & thanked them, but i was absolutely elated after going back inside? it was a mix of good feelings but most of all i felt safer than ever seeing how the real time response was. i don't live in the safest city, & not in the safest neighborhood of my city. i often come home really late from work & these days i've been fearing a lot for my safety. maybe i'm a little bit paranoid, but i really have no means of self defense besides some pepper spray my bf got me. i'm constantly checking under my car, in the back seat, locking the doors as soon as i get in, etc. 

even tho it was by mistake , it means so much that i can feel assured that if something ever happens, i will have help coming to me QUICK. i feel like the creators of noonlight really understand the importance of every minute in a crisis. i'm not one to really review or recommend things, but i will be telling all my friends and family about this lol.

43,Noonlight: Feel Protected 24/7,"I already know what the developers will say, they’ll respond and say “Hey! Thanks for reaching out! The paid membership tiers are completely optional and the app works perfectly fine on the free membership :)” but that’s just as bad. When I first downloaded this app (when it had a different name) all features were free. Now that they’ve developed more intuitive features, they think they should start charging for them. If the developers actually cared about anyone’s safety, every single feature would be free. There are women out there without jobs, whose income is being controlled, some aren’t even old enough to work. 

Asking for even a cent for an extra feature on an app like this is proof that the developers are not maintaining this app because they care about helping vulnerable people, they are doing it for a paycheck. Satisfied users would be MORE THAN HAPPY to donate to the developers, the way many free apps are funded. At this point I wouldn’t give them a dime. Paywalls like this are a slippery slope, what happens when you’re using the app and you press the button and you get a pop up that says “I’m sorry, location services are now a paid feature. We’d be more than happy to call 911 and give them your name though!!”

In fact, I just read a review from LESS THAN A YEAR AGO that said the app used to be COMPLETELY PAY TO USE. How disgusting. Honestly? The developers of this app should be ashamed, this used to be a revolutionary idea to protect women and other at-risk groups, and it quickly turned into a way to make fast cash. It wasn’t until people started leaving bad reviews that you realized that charging to even use the app was a bad idea? Honestly I don’t trust these developers anymore and I wouldn’t even use the free version of the app now, because I don’t trust that a dispatcher will contact the police for me if I don’t give them my credit card number first.",1899,648136937a3b99eab4867ed5
44,Tornado - American Red Cross,"On the day after Christmas last year (2015), North Texas had a severe outbreak of tornadoes. Our city wide alarms went off around 4:45 that afternoon. My husband and I got up and got out dog into our closet, turned on the weather radio and listened to the warnings that were issued for our county but no where close to our vicinity. Because this app can be set to specific zip codes, instead of just counties it gives you a more personalized warning system. You still get the traditional NOAA alerts for warnings (just like on the radio) but along with that, this app has its own warning siren that sounds if the danger is in your specific zip code. 

Another function of the app is that when you click on the warning notification-it brings up a map of the area. Counties included in the warning are shaded in light red and it also shows the path of the tornado in dark red. We live in Midlothian, TX which was in the direct path of the tornado that evening. We thought we heard the radio tell the city of Midlothian to take shelter but the signal wasn't very clear.  Luckily the siren on this app went off at that exact moment and we knew for sure. Most cellular devices will also receive the wireless alert when there is an emergency in the immediate area but depending on just that alone, doesn't give you enough time to get to safety. 

We were very lucky that night and did not have any damage in our exact location but less than a mile away the tornado touched down and destroyed and leveled hundreds of homes. If we wouldn't have had this app to keep us informed, we might not have been so lucky. I informed several nearby friends of the severity of the situation by using the information provided by this one app alone. 

Thank you for creating such a wonderful app!  The resources that it offers actually came in handy for those that had damage and needed to know where to start.",1888,648139067a3b99eab486a6a1
45,Amber Weather,"To be honest, when I first downloaded this app it was just for the clock 
widget. I'm really not that guy who's always so paranoid about the weather 
that I need constant updates. I put up with the notifications for a while, 
and then eventually blocked them. Once I blocked the notifications, the app 
started randomly interrupting what I was doing to launch itself to tell me 
the weather. It wasn't until the app took the next step that I realized 
none of this was about the weather. I'm assuming that people were quitting 
the auto-launching app before the ad could load. So then they started to 
put up self contained ad screens that could be loaded in the background and 
shown to you before you had a chance to cancel them. One day last week I 
was late to work because my alarm clock app never went off. When I opened 
the phone to see why the alarm never went off, it turns out there was an 
Amber interrupt screen waiting for me to clear it. The alarm clock couldn't 
do its thing because Amber needed to show me an ad. Just now, Amber started 
playing a video ad with sound when the phone was sitting on the table 
untouched. The screen didn't turn on, but the sound was playing full 
volume. So there's proof that the app loads and plays ads in the 
background, without any interaction from the user, even after a phone 
reboot. So even without me launching it after a reboot, it keeps itself up 
in system memory and loads/plays media in the background. This has been a 
escalating campaign of intrusive ads. It's been getting worse and worse. 
And now I have proof that this app may be the source of my highly variable 
battery life. (Taking over the system, and executing ads when I think the 
phone is asleep) I don't know for a fact that my battery life will improve 
when I uninstall Amber weather, but at this point I can't wait to find out.",1861,648093f510211d840c777a49

47,PulsePoint Respond,"I work for an ambulance company that responds with LA County Fire to all 911 calls within our area. Although I wouldn't rely on this app to dispatch me or get me to calls, it allows me to see what's going on in my area which can help me get an idea of how far the responding LAC units are and just a general idea of how the day's been going. When comparing the time calls are posted to the app to the time that the LAC dispatcher goes over the air, I would say it generally comes up on the app about 30 seconds after the actual dispatch. Because of this, I don't know how useful this app would be from the perspective of someone trying to respond to calls on their own time. It usually takes under 5 minutes for the fire fighters to arrive on scene and about the same for the ambulance, if not less. I could see this helping in the rare circumstance that you're literally across the street from an emergency, but even then, most 911 calls(from my experience) are not life threatening and would not benefit at all from someone responding besides the designated 911 service providers. Another thing about this app is that LA County dispatch doesn't usually specify cardiac arrests over the app, even if they are aware of it and broadcast it over the dispatch line. For this reason, someone using this app waiting for a cardiac arrest will probably not be alerted about it(as it will usually come as medical emergency) and may miss the call due to the way it's categorized. 

On a side note... Not to be salty, but personally I don't think civilians should be self-responding to 911 calls unless it's a cardiac arrest, and even then it can make things more complicated. 

Overall, I think this app has its uses but I don't necessarily agree with its premise. However, the app works well and it may be a good platform to build on in the future.",1840,648137457a3b99eab4869231

Try it, yes no roads, no grids, but so what, if you can't figure out where you are (in the center of the radar sweep, plus it gives you the name of the place you are closest to, it has to have a focal point of ref). Remember, if you can hear it you can be killed by it. And a lot of DAs are killed every yr. Don't be guessing about your life or someone else's life, be informed. And the advertising isn't so bad, but if an APP is more then just entertaining then you owe it to the developers of the app for possible improvement for future use, rather than just casual use for free. STAY INFORMED STAY ALIVE. Thanks for the use of your APPLICATION developers. Tom",1814,6480bb046e2daf58d26ce661
50,Notfall App für Tirol,"Nice. But now activate an emergency call while in an avalanche, or falling down into an abyss. Or maybe while beeing threathened with a gun. Solution:Trigger the app by pulling out the earphone cable. Can be done in an instant, with gloves, and discretely. Actually, I wrote such an app, for free, without ads, for my own use. I thought it would be a good idea to make it available to everybody for free. Though it was much extra work to make it configruable and easy to use for everybone. Done that, Google did trow it out of the App Store because it had no Datenschutzerklärung (declaration of data usage policy). I could add the app again with such a policy. Problem is, without proper marketing nobody seems to be interested. Therefore I am asking here, if there would be useful such an app for you. After pulling earphone cable, it sends an sms with position for predefined phone numbers, after making an audio recording during position calculation. The audio recording is sent to predefined email addresses. A voice confirmation informs if the actions were successful or not. I also did write a receiving app, which automatically display the position on google maps and plays the audio recording in an endles loop. For dummies. Though, I never posted it in the Play Store yet. All of this features I would be heppy to see in the SOS EU ALP app, so I have no more work with my app. Otherwise, if you like, I could further work on my app. Please give me feedback. Anyway: You cannot issue an SOS call, when you have no mobile network coverage. Which is often the case in the mountains. A satellite phone may elp, but I found no satellite smartphone with Android on it. Nevertheless, I found a 500 Euro Satellite extension vor Samsung Galaxy S4 and others. But I did not test it yet.

53,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"First of all, let me just say... I LOVE citizen. It's truly become an important part of the fabric of New York City and I am constantly telling my friends about this application. Honestly, if you live in this city and love it as much as I do, this is an essential piece of equipment to keep you aware of the world around you, ESPECIALLY in a time where everyone has their headphones in and is more oblivious to the world around them. There is no time like the present to BE present with the ongoing issues that continue to happen here.

HOWEVER

I really think this app could use some serious updates especially when it comes to user personalization. For starters, there should be a personal option to pick and choose your radius and then categorize them based on your preferences (i.e., home, work, current location, etc). Not implying that it's not worthwhile to see all the goings on around you BUT I would personally like to be able to categorize my alerts in terms of importance instead of being notified of something that's 1.5 miles away (in NYC that's quite a good Distance).

Second, I think that there should be a user-to-user option to verify a report. There's been some rather questionable things I've seen in areas around me that I'm not positive about the security or validity of those (this is completely speculative and I could be inaccurate about their own inner workings as far as how they go through these themselves, but I'm not certain)

Overall, there is room for improvement, but I think that everyone should have this application, especially if you're living in a major city. There's nothing more crucial now than to be aware of what's happening around us, and Citizen really gives that control back to the people. Way to go guys, I'll continue to promote your brand as much as I can.",1808,6481297c7a3b99eab485f7d2
54,Disaster Alert,"I seriously think ya'll need to contract with governmental agencies and seek grant money and/or sub contracts for this app. It's OUTSTANDING!!! I was looking for a ""one-stop-shopping"" app for disaster & emergency preparedness and yours is about as close as I've seen. This is what modern society needs! Your product is well designed, great UI and imminently useful. It needs to be utilized at governmental levels--why is it that I get better information from your app than my own U.S. municipality's so-called Emergency Management department?

This app is worth the price & I'd love to see your continued development. Ideas:

/ Customizable news feeds reader sortable by key word & by zip/postal code (ala Gnews). Collaborating with a newsreader beyond your emergency ""sources"" lets users follow media in the disaster region. Gnews is a great highly customizable reader for free google news feeds; it allows a robust keyword & zipcode customization, which lets you track key disaster terms in your own backyard (hopefully not your own backyard, of course, but maybe the backyard of a neighboring community, like the one the boss lives in.)

 / resource page of links to disaster/emergency preparedness sites--this is very trendy in US markets now with the so-called Prepper movement. Or maybe create a user social message board. Something like Resources for Drought, for Earthquakes, Wildfires etc. Also possible links to or templates for Disaster Plans and other useful information so people can be prepared BEFORE disaster strikes. No matter how cool it is to watch on your app, it's a lot less cool to live with it! :-)

/ And yes, Push Notifications. Preferably with some type of fairly robust customization; eg push Earthquake but not Hurricane, or push only earthquake >5.0 or Hurricane > cat 2.",1801,648129ff7a3b99eab485fc5c
55,Amber Weather,"I love the creative options that this app offers. From changing icons, to the design I prefer in my notifications (using SM Galaxy J3, btw), to an almost endless number of super cool widgets (there will soon be an option to build your own), to fingerprint/pattern lock screens, & great 3D live wallpaper! I like customizing everything, so this is right up my alley. Of course, one doesn't have to change or customize a thing (I just like having that option!).   So far as weather reporting being comperable to other apps, Amber Weather is lacking in the bells & whistles that say, weather underground supplies. But it gives me exactly what I was looking for in an app: 7 day+ weather forecast; detailed report; weather warnings in notifications; & reminders each morning & evening so that I can plan my day or niggt accordingly.  I have yet to explore them much, but there are several plug-ins available to download (again, the option to customize is so fantastic); tbh, maybe that's where the bells & whistles of this app lie.   A note about the other 3 apps in the PlayStore, that are also named ""Amber Weather."" From what I can tell, they are the exact same as this App, created by the same awesome developers, & they each integrate with one another (i.e. if you download a different widget skin or lockscreen in 1 Amber Weather app, you should be able to use it in another Amber Weather app »» Devs, please correct me if I'm wrong!!). There are very subtle differences in each, the main one (from what I could tell by using all of them), are the availabilty of more widget skins/backgrounds/etc.!   I'll add on to my review once I explore more, but from my point of view, Amber Weather gets 5★'s from me as one of the most creative, easy-on-the-ram & -data, weather apps out there.",1785,648093f510211d840c777d3c
56,Storm Shield ,"Overall, I love this app. I like the easy to see radar along with it showing all watches and warnings on the map. This gives me a heads up on whether I need to pay more attention to the weather. The talking alerts are great especially if I am away from my phone. I also have MyRadar installed and they both seem to race on who alerts me first. We also love that it sends us alerts to wherever we are - for instance we went on vacation and severe weather hit that area. This app notified us so we weren’t caught off guard when it hit. Plus, we are able to have multiple locations so we are able to notify our parents of impending severe weather in their area. Customer service has been excellent the few times I’ve contacted them. 

Two things I would change:
1. Sometimes if my phone is locked the alert goes to my Apple Watch which doesn’t speak. I fear of missing an alert at night as a result. However the phone talked last night in this scenario so maybe that’s been fixed - it’s the only time it’s done so since I got my Apple Watch in September so we’ll have to see if it was an odd occurrence or actually works now. At any rate, I want it to speak regardless especially if warnings come at night as I can hear the speaking when it happens. 

2. Since we are allowed to have multiple locations on the phone it would be nice to have a customized sound or the alert saying the city or county. We have alerts for us and where our parents live all 2 hours in the opposite directions. We have to go to the phone when an alert goes off because we have no idea which location it is that’s alerting us about. That can be annoying if we were doing something away from the phone and have to stop what we are doing and go to it to see where it is. 

Overall, I’d still recommend the app!",1782,648138137a3b99eab486984e
57,Noonlight: Feel Protected 24/7,"This is an AMAZING app. It makes me feel so much safer. Here’s how SafeTrek works. In the event of an emergency, release your thumb and do not enter your pin within the allotted 10 seconds. After 10 seconds of releasing the blue button, our 24/7 emergency call center will be notified. If SafeTrek's safety advisors are unable to verify your safety either through texting or a phone call, they will notify your local police department providing them with your full name, phone number and current location. In addition, our safety advisors will provide them real-time location updates and continue to assist you until help arrives. SafeTrek not only locates you quicker and more accurately than 911, but it can also track your location during an emergency helping ensure you receive help even if you can not speak or do not know where you are at.The other day I was coming home from school and when I got home my mom was on her way home from work. I was doing my normal routine and I thought I heard something upstairs. So I pulled out my phone and used SafeTrek while I looked around my house. When I was done I put my phone back in my pocket and continued what I was doing. A few mins later I heard my phone buzzing and it said that SafeTrek was sending emergency services. Apparently I forgot to put in my PIN number! I was trying to cancel the emergency and it started calling 911. I hung up when it started dialing and a few mins later I got a call and the person said that they got a call at 911 from me. Then a little  later I got a text from Zach at SafeTrek checking on me. Zach has been EXTREMELY helpful and nice! YOU NEED THIS APP! The thing that surprised me the most is how nice the people at SafeTrek are! I would give this app a 10 out of 5 stars! It's that good.",1778,648136937a3b99eab4868ac2
58,SoSecure: Personal Safety. Live Emergency Response,"I downloaded this app just because I thought it was pretty cool, I used to work with ADT so I’ve always liked most of their products. I never really thought I would need to activate the apps panic button but tonight I did. I was out at the marina by myself just enjoying a smoke and the pretty view of downtown Jacksonville FL, and it was just me out there until this man came walking real slowly down the street towards the dock I was on. When he made it to the dock as he was walking down he was talking really weird and said “It’s your turn to die tonight, get ready, I am deaths assistant”. Obviously this made me feel super uncomfortable so as he got close enough to touch me I moved around him and kept my face turned towards him so I could see what he was doing. I had my phone in my hand and I was thinking of the SOS button on the iPhone where you click the power button three times and it plays a sirens DJ calls 911, but then I saw the SoSecure app, so I opened the app and clicked “SOS Chat” and almost instantly Ryane from ADT came on the line to assess the situation. Ryane stayed on the line with me as I kept him informed about the situation and gave him a description. Since I rode my E-bike out here I didn’t have much shelter to protect myself if I needed to, so Ryane stayed on the line until I got off of that road. Just as I was about to end the chat my bike tired went flat which obviously made me even more nervous, and Ryane stayed with me until I made it to my house safe and sound, with my exact location as I was moving, ready to send help if needed. Just can’t beat that peace of mind. I’ll definitely be paying that $9/mo after my trial expired just for the added peace of mind… this was a life saver tonight. I was so scared, not even gonna lie.",1776,6481377e7a3b99eab48694b2
59,Hurricane Tracker,"Devs: iOS13, iPhone XS Max, this app is giving double notifications which is absolutely maddening.

Now, my thoughts on the app: First, you purchase the app, which is essentially a graphical UI built to read the NHC page. Good stuff. Not my first choice, but the app I loved before stopped support and was no longer functional. 

Then, it uses cheesy Saffir-Simpson scales to nickel and dime you a bit. Totally optional. Once you've made it to the bottom of the graphics, you'll find that there is now a link to ""premium"" graphics that contain a whole new level (additional to the current compilation) of publicly available information compiled into brightly colored graphics, complete with a whole slew of watermarks and copyrights. Again, optional, but 25 bucks for 6 months? Storm season isn't year round. I'd probably fork over 10 bucks annually, at the most, and I'm certainly not participating in a circumvention of the app store to PayPal and an outside ""login"". My Apple credentials are enough, it's not like this is Radarscope that provides expert level meteorological data to analyze. 

Pacific and other international users, consider this your warning: the ""premium"" content isn't available to you yet, but you'll be nearly to the point of giving them that 25 bucks before they tell you. I recommend making that a much more visible and prominent announcement, because you're going to irritate a lot of folks if your defense is ""well, we listed it all the way down here in the terms and conditions"", especially if you don't have an estimated date of deployment for availability to all users. 

Overall: room to improve for a paid app, the ""premium"" features could be those improvements, but it'll cost you significantly more relative to the original purchase.",1769,64812d927a3b99eab4860c2c
60,My Hurricane Tracker - Tornado Alerts & Warnings,"I've got or have tried so many other weather apps and storm trackers, but This app is hands down the best hurricane tracker available for Apple devices! And it's FREE! 

Here's why...

EASY TO USE AND CLEAN LAYOUT So easy to use and understand that even I can use every feature with my severe case of Attention Deficit Disorder (I'm not kidding). Very clean and clear layout of information, Map, Cone, Satellite, Models and news. 

MAP - The map is awesome!!! It uses the 3D Apple Map image with point by point locations of the storm's path from beginning to it's predicted end. Use the forward or backward arrows or Press on any point of the storm's path and you get information of it's location (coordinates and miles away) at the time, forward speed and pressure.

PUSH NOTIFICATIONS - Immediate notifications alerts and updates to my iPhone. Times of notifications match the time of information released from the National Hurricane Center.

I'm getting notifications almost ONE HOUR FASTER than Accuweather (ranked #3)!!! This is very important. Especially when the Hurricane I'm currently tracking is intensifying rapidly. It was upgraded to a Category 4 from a Cat 1 in less than 12 hours.

I'm currently watching Hurricane Delta as it's predicted to hit Louisiana. I'm still recovering from the aftermath of Hurricane Laura. 

This app is now my go to source for Hurricane and Tornado watches. It proudly sits on my phone's home page. I will purchase the Ad removal just to support it. The ads are just a small banner on the bottom of the screen that doesn't interfere with anything. But this developer deserves to be supported for his great work and will hopefully help him keep this valuable tool updated for many years to come. 

Thank you 🙏🏼",1752,648130257a3b99eab486273e
61,NOAA Weather Radar Live & Alerts,"The reason for this poor review is the ads. I understand that apps need 
support and payment but there is such a thing as a reasonable level. The 
ads are too frequent, and egregiously in-your-face. They would flout every 
expectation of anything resembling an ""acceptable ads"" idea. I got this app 
on a road trip after a storm in North Dakota, and tried to use it the next 
day as we headed in to Montana. What I was looking for, and it initially 
seemed to have, was storm weather animations for the last hour or two, 
queued in 5 or 15 minute intervals. The fact that this app actually seemed 
to be able to do that was wonderful. However, the experience actually was 
like this: Loadloadload... ad that takes over the full screen. dismiss it, 
try to look at the map. loadloadload, ok, here's the map. zoom out slightly 
to check where we're heading. oh, wait, loadloadload ad. Ok, it loads the 
new animation and all is good. now, lock the screen. 5 minutes later, I've 
forgotten where exactly the storm clouds are, so let me just unlock the 
screen to look, some the animation was looping the last time. oh, another 
ad. close it, and look, it has managed to forget the location I was looking 
at and has zoomed in to the immediate area I was in 5 minutes back. and 
nope, I have spotty connectivity now, and have lost that image/animation I 
was looking at. Terrible experience using it, sheer frustration if for the 
fact that there was so much potential for it to be actually useful. Yes, 
there is a paid version, but that has no way to pay for it directly. The 
only option seems to be an auto-renewing yearly subscription. Again, there 
can be leeway for that but only in the presence of goodwill, which this app 
does not foster.",1744,6480950d991eb46aaf10a0b0
62,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"I’ve been using Citizen for several months now, and my thoughts/feelings/experiences have varied. I live in Downtown LA, which is wild, so Citizen has been both helpful, as well as traumatic. This is not Citizen’s fault, it’s where I chose to live; however, the manner with which certain users engage within the app can be downright disturbing. 

Just today, someone threatened to find me and shoot me for no reason. When I have live feed videos that other users can access (mine are private), this is extremely alarming. This is not a safe area, and it’s because there are unsafe people who may decide to carry out these threats. 

Citizen needs to do a better job of monitoring what people are saying in the comments. Yes, Citizen will turn off the comments get violent/racist/evil/etc., but these people who troll the comments are not being reprimanded. 

Today was the first day I have been threatened, but I don’t expect to be the last. Do better, Citizen. 

Over the last few months, a number of updates to the app have been implemented, some of which remain, while others are removed (e.g., likes & dislikes). I’m not a fan of the new Home Screen, which is from more of a distance, and it has random icons or images about the incident. The yellow and red dots were fine as they were. 

I don’t know why I receive alerts from areas over 10 miles away, or why so many irrelevant incidents are listed in my ‘Incident List.’  It’s not like these locations are places I frequently visit. I’ve never been to 95% of them. 

I have a lot more comments, but these are a few. 

While it sounds like I may really dislike this app, that’s not the case. I really appreciate it, but I feel like there needs to be greater oversight.",1724,6481297c7a3b99eab485f6d6
63,Noonlight: Feel Protected 24/7,"I live in a sketchy area. While minding my own business eating at a local restaurant, I was horrified when a homeless man I had never seen before suddenly appeared behind me and physically attacked me for no reason. After the restaurant had him arrested and I pressed charged, I won a restraining order against him.

So after seeing this app advertised on YouTube, I figured it was an excellent choice to have just in case anything else happened.

Unfortunately, I just discovered that it has a serious flaw.

I had to go to the store for groceries, and as I approached the store I noticed someone acting in a strange manner towards anyone they saw. So after paying for my food, I held my bag of groceries in one hand and my phone in my free one ready to open up this app just in case.

As I walked outside, the individual noticed me and started slowly in my direction, I tried to walk another way as I opened up the app... and got a shock.

The app was insisting that I couldn’t USE it unless I entered my Apple ID password! (Did it update itself without my knowledge?) And we all know how needlessly complicated Apple insists passwords have to be nowdays! There was no way I could enter that password one handed while carrying a huge bag of groceries and trying to stay away from some shadowy following figure late at night! The app was thoroughly useless in my situation, and I was terrified. So I prepared to call 911 instead just in case something happened.

Luckily I lost them and got home safely, but that was ridiculous. There was no reason I could see why thst should have happened, especially since it later showed me as still being logged in.

Fix, please! I’m paying good money monthly for this app to work! D:",1723,648136937a3b99eab4868a8a
64,WAFF 48 First Alert Weather,"Update June 23, 2018 for the current version, again. Gave up on 48 and got 
Live Alert 19. It works on my phone much better than 48's. June 22, 2018 
for the current version - latest update unstable on my phone (still full of 
ads). First, if you don't want all the notices, turn them off in the 
settings. They are turned on by default, and they can be annoying. Today 
the radar started giving me a lot of trouble. I open it, there is no data 
on it. I close it and reopen it, still no data. When it is behaving this 
way, it may take four times of opening and closing before any data 
displays. Today, I started the radar animated history and the screen went 
completely blank. Finally had to uninstall and reinstall to get the radar 
to work again. The radar was the only thing I cared about and now, when I 
want to quickly see what is happening, it is a craps shoot as whether it 
will work or not. Also, it is promoted by 48 as accurate and current. Don't 
know how it is populated or updated, but the only thing that seems to be 
accurate and current is the radar, when it works. Many times the app's 
hourly forecast does not match the on air forecast. On air forecast may be 
for no rain and the app hourly shows rain. Shouldn't be too surprised, many 
times the on air Forecast does not match the real weather. Getting harder 
and harder to plan activities based on app or on air forecast. Maybe I'm 
expecting too much from all meteorologists, but the way they report the 
weather, they are inviting us to expect more of them. As for the app, the 
radar and it's history is the only thing I count on, when it loads. I still 
look at the Hourly, but only if the current hour is matching the current 
weather.",1719,64809334f53b7cd366042273
65,Noonlight: Feel Protected 24/7,"Tonight I accidentally opened the Noonlight app and obviously didn’t put the code in stating I was safe because I wasn’t aware that I had even done it. I received several phone calls from an unknown number and I just never answer unknown numbers but it was from Noonlight checking to see if I was OK, as well as four text messages trying to check on me. unfortunately I was getting ready to leave the house and moving around quickly and grabbing things like my purse and keys and phone so I wasn’t paying any attention to the actual screen of the phone   When I didn’t answer those calls or text Noonlight alerted authorities and six police officers in two cop cars showed up at my house just as I was leaving. I was very confused and it took me about an hour to figure out what it happened but I am so incredibly thankful that they had sent the police over just in case. Had it been a real emergency I would have been saved for sure. I’m so very impressed now that I’ve actually seen the procedure of what would happen in an emergency that I’m going to make sure to spread the word on my social media accounts and to friends and family personally (about Noonlight) so they can also feel secure and safe the way that I do having the app. I do wanna apologize to Noonlight for my negligence when not paying attention to the app getting opened and to make sure that doesn’t happen again. I’ve moved the app to a more secure location in my phone so it’s slightly more difficult to accidentally open it. I don’t ever want to waste valuable time of our police force accidentally again. I now feel completely secure and safe knowing I have the Noonlight app. Thanks Noonlight Team. You really came through for me tonight!",1715,648136937a3b99eab48689a2
66,Storm Shield ,"I’ve had this app for years now, and after using it for so long, I can honestly say it’s just OK. What’s not so great is that the Doppler is not up to the minute CURRENT. With the basic purchase, you only get a view of conditions from several minutes ago. Here in Florida, you know how conditions can change in a split second as far as severe storms go. I’ll be trapped in the supermarket staring at Doppler on the app, trying to decipher if the storm pouring down outside is going to let up any time soon, and this app is not good for that, since it’s MINUTES behind, for the basic version. For the version that will show you the most CURRENT conditions, you must pay a monthly fee. Another thing that’s not great about this app, you will never get lightning alerts. In the lightning Capitol of the USA, you need that. You can pay a monthly fee for that feature as well. I considered paying for the lightning alerts out of desperation because we spend a lot of time outdoors playing, working, and for school activities, but then I found another excellent app, WeatherBug, that includes current conditions AND lightning alerts FOR FREE. I get alerts when lightning is 10 miles away or closer, and I can view the screen showing exactly where the strike was. And it is very accurate in its warning system! I instantly get an alert and within a second or two I hear the thunder! Now, for hurricane tracking, that’s what Storm Shield is good for, because that shows warnings and watches, and the track. It’s kind of tricky to figure out settings to view the hurricane tracking and to be able to view storms that are a few minutes passed, and opacity of colors, but once you figure that out, it’s a helpful app.",1706,648138137a3b99eab486982c
67,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"I found this app to be useful at first to know what was happening in real time. In the end it hasn’t made me feel more safe, it makes me feel in danger all the time when likely it is the same amount of crime there always was. Unfortunately as the country is as it is, I find this app to be a place where people report ‘outside fires’ when it is just a Black family having a cookout, and surmise as to the race of criminals in ways that try to sound like they are in the know. It could be a full time job to delete coded (or not) racist comments from this app. Additionally it supports a kind of wild conjecturing about tragic events that does nothing but raise anxiety. Last night tragically a woman committed suicide within a few miles from our home. The crowd-sourced comments somehow escalated this deeply sad event to being a ‘woman fatally assaulted on a bridge’. How is this helping people? If people using the app see this and don’t check back they believe that someone is going around murdering women on bridges. It raises fear and mistrust of one another, raises anxiety (the comment section was filled with notes like ‘I have to move from this city’ etc) and it generally from what I’ve witnessed gives a platform to people spreading fear about communities that don’t look like their own and then troll others that don’t agree with them. I am wondering what the developers intended or if it has gotten out of control for them. I think the comment section should be heavily monitored or deleted. I think also there should be a review process for events. How on earth does a cookout get reported as an outside fire? I feel we are safer as a community without this app stoking fear and tension.",1701,6481297c7a3b99eab485f6b3
68,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"The app is buggy, between crashes, odd behavior, and bugs which cause long-lasting high CPU usage that’s noticeable by how hot your phone gets while running the app and how quickly it drains your battery. 

Beyond that, while the idea is great, the implementation is horrific to the point of being damaging to society in my opinion. Everything about it is done in a way to maximize fear of crime regardless of whether that’s a reasonable reaction. The comment sections are poorly moderated and fill with trolls and completely fabricated claims that are pro-fear of crime. 

For example, gun suicides end up as report of “person shot”. Those reports always end up full of trolls and propagandists spouting false claims about crime. I posted a kind comment in one such “person shot” threads asking people to please be respectful as many such “person shot” reports on Citizen are suicides. That wasn’t even really a criticism of Citizen in my comment (though it would have been justified), yet they deleted my comment and left up a bunch of comments from trolls and people making false claims about crime. Ultimately, it was sadly a suicide and the report of police coming to their death was full of trolls and disgusting comments based in lies, while my comment kindly asking people to be respectful because there was a high chance of it being a suicide got censored by Citizen because they don’t care about reality, and love inducing fear. 

Citizen’s interest is in making you fear crime as much as possible regardless of whether that’s a reasonable fear, so you pay them. That’s a horrific incentive and the way they run things shows the end result of a company driven by such a perverse incentive.",1699,6481297c7a3b99eab485f745
69,KATWARN,"Habe die App vor einiger Zeit installiert und bis jetzt hat sie mir nix gemeldet. Heute dann die erste Meldung: Großbrand in Hamburg (mit vermutlich giftigem Rauch, da Elekto-Recycling-Firma brennt). Und tatsächlich – nur ein paar hundert Meter entfernt. So viel dazu...

Nun zu meinen Vorrednern und den 1-Sterne-Bewertungen. In den Einstellungen unter Deutscher Wetterdienst steht „[…] bundesweit Unwetterwarnungen der höchsten Stufe (‚Extremes Unwetter‘). Bitte beachten Sie, dass Meldungen der niedrigeren Stufen wie ‚Unwetter‘ oder ‚merkanntes Wetter‘ nicht gemeldet werden.“ Also nicht immer gleich eine schlechte Bewertung abgeben, wenn eine App nicht tut was sie ausdrücklich nicht verspricht…

Un zu guter letzt zu den Einstellungen der App: Schade ist tatsächlich, dass man nur zwei Postleitzahlen für die Warnungen aktivieren kann. Mehr wären schon sinnvoll.

Und nun zu meiner 3-Sterne Bewertung und dem größten Kritikpunkt: Neben den zwei Postleitzahlen, die man einstellen kann kann man sich auch basierend auf der eigenen Position warnen lassen („Schutzengel""). Problem dabei ist, dass dann permanent – NEIN, SOGAR UNUNTERBROCHEN – die GEO-Position abgefragt wird. Das ist sogar dann der Fall, wenn die App gar nicht läuft. Wer diese Funktion also nutzen will, der sollte sich auf eine drastisch kürzere Batterie-Laufzeit einstellen! Für mich ist diese Funktion somit unbrauchbar ; \

Da nun einer meiner Vorredner dies schon bemängelt hat, jedoch meint, dass sich die Funktion nicht deaktivieren lasse hier noch ein kleiner Tipp: Einfach der App in den Privatsphäre-Einstellungen den Zugriff auf die Ortungsdienste verbieten … Dann hat sich der „Schutzengel“ erledigt ; )",1687,64812f8b7a3b99eab4861edd
70,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"This app (Back then) was good to use, a certain incident would pop up and you look at said incident and it tells you the information and where it is, it even had little extra videos and or cop communications over the radio little sound files that you can listen too. That’s barebones what the app is. 

PAY TO USE! 
Heres the Ugly or downright disgusting part of the app. The more “Extensive” features are considered premium or luxury and they will keep pushing it to you. Remember how I’m the recent paragraph was mentioning how you can watch videos and or sound clips of emergency response? Well, you can’t anymore, there is a paywall behind it. Every. Single. One.

You tap on an incident, you watch 5 seconds of video, boom, $5.99 to watch the rest. You listen to the emergency response boom $5.99, you even start up the app, guess what $5.99 is one of the first things they introduce when you start the app for the first time.

What really gets me the worst and really riled up. You can’t see past live streams that YOU YOURSELF made. Before this app was Pay to Use, if you live streamed, you can check the comments and full video you recorded and the full EMR radio and see how many views/comments on it and look back on the awareness you have spread.

Well not anymore. This very disappointing $5.99 subscription added that you can’t see videos or EMR conversations, even the past livestreams that YOU have made. Me myself remembers watching my streams before the Paywall update and seeing all my videos in full then now after the update, its all locked behind a $5.99

Sorry Citizen, you will not get anything at all from me, good bye, you lost a good long term citizen user…",1683,6481297c7a3b99eab485f6d8
71,PulsePoint Respond,"PulsePoint is an amazing app that allows first responders to be alerted and know what is going on in their local/ community. PulsePoint has allowed my volunteer fire company to respond to fires quicker. We have been alerted by PulsePoint while at the station many times for house fires, sometimes even minutes before the pagers go off! It also is amazing because it allows us to know who is en route and who is on scene. While all incorporating the calls onto a map. I believe it’s an game changing app and it will continue to be of good use in the future to fire company’s big and small around the United States! I highly recommend it to other first responders. 

Now to my wants... or wishes if you would! I would like to see more options of notifications especially for the new types of calls on the app. Maybe notifications for trash fires, vehicle fires, investigations, and gas leaks. I would also love it if the app would allow you too pick what areas you are notified for. My county is very large and my phone seems to go off a lot for fires I don’t necessarily want to be notified about😂 
Any who, I would like to see maybe a area you could draw out or a by township alert system. Such as, I only want to be notified for fires, accidents and so on in the following townships blank, blank, and blank.        And then I would only get a notification for them so when my PulsePoint goes off I know I’m probably going to an emergency, rather then being let down that the fire is 5 fire station locals away😭. And to conclude my Statement of words😂 I would like to pat PulsePoint on the back for being an amazing app! Good job people who made it and continue to make it great!",1679,648137457a3b99eab4868f78
72,The Weather Channel,"I used to love this app then the ads got insane. I dealt with the ads for a while and then decided to go ahead and pay for the app. I purchased the premium app and felt like the $5 was a fair price for access to all Weather Channel content. Then I tried to login with my PC and found that the $5 only works on the app. $5 per platform? There’s not even a bundle option?!? Its 2021, all the content generated on a website can easily be adapted for IOS or Android. A business pretending that each platform costs extra is either using outdated tech or their staff is incompetent. Anyone can use Wix to build a website that accessible from any platform, and you’re telling me The Weather Channel tech team can’t figure that out? The same company that can literally track the weather can’t figure out an app? Bah. You don’t pay extra to use Netflix or any other mainstream app on multiple platforms, so why does The Weather Channel think that’s ok? Either way, the customer is the one getting screwed while The Weather Channel double dips. Yall got my $5 for a month, so I hope you enjoy it. Yall would have literally made 12x that a year without the shady practices. There must be a lot of people who fall for this. Since I can’t trust the company, I'll cancel the app and use another service. I'll leave 1 star because the content, if you can access it, is good. The common response for these kinds of reviews is that they are ""working on it"" and trying to find a fix. To that I say sure you are. The reviews complaining about this company’s shady ""premium"" features and ads go back years. Absolutely appalling. I just wish I'd read the reviews before wasting money.",1663,6480951dd58440aff03608eb
73,KATWARN,"Das Gebiet, für das gewarnt wird, ist zu groß. Daher gibt es oft Warnungen zum Beispiel über Unwetter und es kommt dann gar kein Unwetter. Wenn das ein paarmal passiert ist, nimmt man die App nicht mehr sonderlich ernst. Umgekehrt warnt die App oft zu spät. Draußen regnet und stürmt es und eine Viertelstunde später kommt eine Warnung. Und zum Amoklauf in München braucht man wohl kaum noch etwas zu sagen, hier hat die App wegen Überlastung vollkommen versagt. Die Warnung der App kam 2 Stunden zu spät und war damit völlig nutzlos.

Zu Bedienung/UI: Ich habe beim Support angefragt, ob man in die App nicht eine Nachtschaltung für den Benachrichtigungston einbauen könnte. Natürlich sind die Warnungen wichtig, aber eben nicht alle und manchmal will ich sie eben nicht hören, zum Beispiel nachts. Eine Nachtschaltung zur Unterdrückung des Tons wäre daher sinnvoll. Am besten wäre eine Auswahlmöglichkeit für bestimmte Warnungen. Starkregen ist mir in der Nacht wohl egal, ein Katastrophenunwetter oder Terroranschlag natürlich nicht. KATWARN verweigert dies aber grundsätzlich. Man solle die iOS ""nicht stören"" Funktion verwenden. Dies hätte natürlich Auswirkungen auf alle Apps, und das will ich ja gerade nicht. Alternativ solle ich halt den Ton ausstellen. Sehr lustig, auch das hat Einfluss auf alle Apps und das will ich nicht. Dann könne man ja abends bei den Mitteilungen der App den Ton immer ausstellen. Das soll ich also jeden Abend machen und morgens wieder einstellen? Unglaublich, wie ignorant Support sein kann. Warum werden die Nutzer so bevormundet? Warum baut man es nicht als Option in die App ein und lässt die Nutzer selbst entscheiden?",1659,64812f8b7a3b99eab4861e83
74,Hurricane Tracker,"My original review from 2016:

I purchased this app specifically to stay updated on the progress of Hurricane Matthew (I live in central Florida.) The app functioned well until sometime around 11:00 pm on the night landfall was expected, then failed. By ""failed"" I mean it quit providing NHC advisories or graphics. Let me be clear: I never lost power, and my wifi remained functioning throughout the night, but this app quit providing critical information at the most critical time. If you are considering the purchase of this app to keep you informed during a hurricane emergency, look elsewhere. I could not be more dissatisfied with this app. If I could have given it zero stars I would have done so. EZ Apps, Inc. has done a great disservice to any who, like me, relied on this app to provide what could have been life-saving information in the midst of a massive category 4 hurricane.

UPDATE, 5/22/17. I received a response overnight from the developer explaining that the aforementioned failure was the result of NOAA's systems crashing. As the 2017 hurricane season is upon us, I'll give this app another run, and re-evaluate my rating at the end of the season.

UPDATE, 9/27/17. Whatever issues may have been evident last year when I first reviewed this app have apparently been resolved. I live in Lakeland, FL, and Hurricane Irma passed directly through our city. This app functioned well (with a few minor and short-lived freeze-ups) through the entire grueling ordeal of that storm. Congratulations on continuing to improve this app, and on addressing previous deficiencies. This app was a tremendous asset as Irma approached and moved on.",1653,64812d927a3b99eab4861828
75,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"I originally gave this app 5 stars.. Unlike 2 other better touted apps this one actually tells me about crime and actually tells me where it is. //// I changed it to 1 because the contact tracing feature requires Bluetooth. I will not enable Bluetooth, because suddenly nothing on my phone that has to connect to the Internet or to my phone service provider connects. There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about contract tracing that should need BLUETOOTH. ALL Bluetooth does for you is wireless device connections I don't need and have found a nuisance. What, does it want and need to connect to my neighbors' wireless devices in order to know who I have had contact with? Talk about invasion of privacy - don't even think about it.///// The makers of this device need to get over themselves. I would use contact tracing if it worked normally. If I get ONE MORE NAG about ANYTHING TO DO WITH CONTACT TRACING FUNCTIONALITY I'm liable to uninstall it! /// And DON""T TALK BACK TO ME ABOUT THIS REVIEW, it won't improve your rating! In fact, I'm changing my rating to 2, so I can change it to 1 if you talk back to me! Most app makers are WAY TOO ARROGANT to have any idea when not to open their mouths. ////

In fact, just because the notion that you would connect to my neighbors' Bluetooth devices in order to know where I am and who I am near, is so aggregious, that, I am just going to notify some tech sources and any review of this app to make them aware of the serious invasion of privacy! Whether I want the government to know where I've been is one matter; whether I want you knowing about my neighbors' Bluetooth devices is quite another.",1636,648093ceba8226394e6c99e1
76,Personal Safety,"There's a balance between paranoia of collecting too much private data that may be shared with 3rd parties, and rapid access to information in case of emergency. This app seems like it will be very useful, if first responders are actually trained to check your phone. I'd hope that Google is reaching out to them about this. For most people, it isn't a big deal. If you're in a car crash or other disabling emergency, they just need to know that you need a hospital, and when you wake up, you'll be able to ask to contact people. For some people, they need a list of meds daily. Without that information, unless you happened to have all your med bottles with you, those critical medications may be missed. 6 hours after a car crash, you may go into a hypertensive crisis. It'd be much better if they already knew how much of what drugs work for you, so you won't add heart attack to your list of problems. It's not usually a secret who your close friends are. You're already sending them IMs and emails on a regular basis. Listing them in this way isn't really a security risk. The NSA already knows who they are. You need the paramedics or nurse in the hospital to know too. I am against sharing too much data. I've seen what datamining companies have, and it disturbs me. This is one of the rare good reasons to share your private data. I'm tentatively giving 5 stars. If a team of covert operatives take me away to a black site, I'll change it to 1 star. If it doesn't help in an actual emergency, the stars are going down. Looks like 2021 will be a good year for hurricanes, there should be plenty of chances to test it.",1624,6480931829b62ce154d75beb
77,The Weather Channel,"I love it!  I don't even have to think about checking the weather, I get alerts and am always the first to know what is coming next which I like.  With two active kids under age 7 we spend as much time as possible outdoors so this app helps me find that 1 hour pocket of dry time between the rain for a park visit, or the best time to go play in the fleeting Oregon snow, or when to plan on avoiding a nasty dangerous commute.  I also love the specific and frequent weather/storm updates and alerts, not just locally but all over the US and links to international breaking news.  We have family and friends all over the US, Canada, UAE, Europe, South America, etc so it's always good to know what's going on everywhere.  I used to skip between 3 or 4 major weather sites and piece it all together but now the weather channel does it for me.  Also, people complain about the adds, and they used to bother me, but this is a quality news outlet and they aren't a charity working for free, they have to pay for this to work somehow!  I feel the 10 second (or so) ads are barely even noticeable and have actually been appropriate, tasteful, and very short for the most part.  I think a few seconds of my time here and there is a very small price to pay for a FREE service of quality.  That said, I would pay for this app to be add free just to support you guys, like 3 bucks/mo or so, maybe more if you added some fun features or bonuses.  I don't know if that could come close to touching your ad revenue though..... I wrote a book lol.  Bottom line, I love it!  Thank you for a great app that helps me stay informed.",1613,6480a525d58440aff03893d7
78,Hurricane Tracker,"Rather disappointed with Hurricane Tracker App as of late May 2023. Not only does the developer (EZ Apps, Inc.) initially charge for the app download (obviously this was not an issue), but now the developer wants an additional $25 yearly subscription to view “premium” content for the Atlantic basin only. 
First, users have already paid for content with initial download payment. Second, ironic that only the upgraded premium content applies to the very active area of the Atlantic Basin where a vast number of storms develop and/occur during hurricane season and beyond. So, a certain region is singled out only! Third, while I have absolutely no data to back up this statement, I would imagine a large number of users for this region use this app as a weather detection monitor and/or early warning updates given the high volatility of hurricanes and even severe weather. Finally, might you consider offering more premium content to attract new users to download your app versus gouging the paid users. Old adage: attract more flies with honey 

**Will update star rating if changes noted on developer’s end/Hurr Tracker App

Per the app: 
GO PREMIUM and get access to highly detailed graphics from the Hurricane Tracker App team! Currently available for active Atlantic Basin storms that threaten land. Based on NHC data of course!

App downloads have been decreasing year over year and we wanted to proivide a service that would give our users more detail and your support ensures the Hurricane Tracker App keeps going for years to come.

79,NOAA Weather Radar Live & Alerts,"A most outstanding app. I live in Rockport-Fulton, Texas and on August 
25,2017, I hunkered down in my small wood framed home only 4 blocks from 
the shore. As a 30 year retired paramedic, I wanted to stay and try to be 
of help to those I knew would certainly need it after Harvey had passed. 
After spending two straight days away from commercial media and under the 
impression that the storm would approach at Cat 2 level, 3 at worst, while 
I was out helping others board up and get out of town. My little cottage 
was last on my list to prepare. By the time I got it done and receive the 
latest reports, It was way too late to evacuate. During this potentially 
deadly storm, at first, I relied on cable TV for up to date info. But that 
didn't last long because the cable was the first to go. As the winds 
approached 130mph, it was the electricity that went. My car was sheltered 
in a garage and provided continuous power for my mobile phone and this APP 
to keep me in touch with the world and knowledge of the Beast that raged 
outside. First in one direction, then after the eye passed, in the opposite 
direction. As the storm moved inland, the farthest and last cell tower I 
could use finally went down. The wind was appx 140mph with gusts to 160mph 
right here at home sweet home. Lesson learned. 1) I will NEVER ride out a 
killer hurricane again because dead paramedics have never saved anyone. 2) 
NOAA Weather Radar is the absolute best friend you can have when a beast 
like Harvey is knocking on the door. Many thanks to a great team for being 
there when I needed you the most!",1601,6480950d991eb46aaf10a7ff
80,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"It’s a good app to keep yourself up to date with the latest happenings in your area and monitor what its degenerates are up to so you can avoid areas where incidents are highlighted. 

However, Citizen has chosen to inappropriately moderate comments that don’t have a liberal slant, and has removed any comments critical of situations like the riots that have sparked throughout my local area. We ARE allowed to express disapproval for these actions as it is our first-amendment right to do as such, and yet Citizen will remove comments from people who are not enthusiastic at the prospect of having their neighbourhood become a war zone or having their businesses looted by 21st century vandals. 

As long as no one is saying things that are threats, sharing pornographic links, or using racial slurs, there should be no moderation of comments. People falsely mass-flagging comments they don’t like as abusive is also a huge issue that needs to be taken seriously, as this is a known tactic of political extremist groups to do in order to silent dissent, and Citizen needs to take this abuse of their app’s mechanics more seriously. There should be an option for false comment flaggers to have their accounts suspended from commenting as well, not just those being attacked.

A first amendment right to free speech includes protests, but it does not include looting and riots. It also most certainly includes the ability to be critical of these protests without being abused for it, and your moderation team needs to focus on the people trying to silence anyone who’s critical of free speech.",1593,6481297c7a3b99eab485f6c7

OH! not to even mention the amount of toxicity in the comments, such as hard racism, people that are happy people died, death wishes, lgbt+ phobia, classism, ignorant political strife, victim blaming, and more. i got temp banned for making yo mama jokes, but so many users regularly being blatantly hateful and encouraging death and violence are left free to spread their hate. if you report a comment, it just deletes it from your view. its unknown whether anything is actually done about certain things. maybe they do considering i got temp banned for innocuous jokes, but the widespread hate and ignorance on there gives me no hope they actually do anything about hateful conduct. its ridiculous.",1591,6481297c7a3b99eab485f7ff

Mobile Device. In order to use the Service in any manner, you must enable your mobile device as follows:  to receive push notifications from the App; to permit the App to access both the camera and microphone for your device (at your election); and to permit the App to access your location (even in the background, i.e., when the App is not open on your device).

Even better are the occasional alerts at 2-3AM with a blaring siren noise that wakes everyone in a 5 miles radius... oh and to notify us all that light rain is approaching (not literally but might as well be light rain). There is NO WAY to change alerts other than entirely disable in iOS settings. You want a repeat of what you already get on any number of social media apps? Info you already get from many weather and news apps that you receive before citizen even knows there's an issue?

I just checked- I currently have 32 active subs in many categories and this is by far the most expensive... thankfully I gave this app a try for a few weeks before paying for it.

Last, this is also the only app I have and ever had that not only requires my location all the time but my precise location in order to even use it. Sorry... my privacy is important to me, my data isn't for sale... and I'm certainly not going to pay you to profit from my data.

84,Storm Shield ,"24.May.2020 Revisited review: StormShield is again requesting a review and I wish I had dated my previous submission because it remains critically on point and StormShield  does not display its submission date. The prior review that I continue to stand by to follow: “Of course I have used this app for years and it has performed flawlessly (and I mean that), but never bothered to give it a rating. It is only now that it has become so slow and glitchy that I bother to finally rate it. 1) I launch the app in the middle of a thunderstorm and deluge and the display at the same location shows not cloud in the sky. 2) If and when there is thunderstorm display, random blocks or quadrants of the display are blank. 3) The ‘Play / Pause’ display function may or may not decide to comply though its icon says otherwise. 4) Should the ‘Play’ display function decide to actually comply, the time-stamped storm movement may just stop in its movement or most likely it will cycle ONCE and then STOP rather than repeating through the prior 30-45 minute time span as it once did. 5) After having purchased the purportedly full app in good faith, the now optional ‘Future’ function for an ongoing monthly fee belies the app’s public service quality because if the technology to provide the information is already existent (ie, available to and paid for by the issuer), then it should be incorporated into the app for its existing clientele. Bottom line: Just get it together or it will be money wasted as people move on to another, more reliable, better app. Thanks for reading...Velocitoro”",1582,648138137a3b99eab4869e36
85,Storm Shield ,"Received a response from the developer who advised there are lots of free items included but I still don’t honestly feel it’s right to charge a monthly subscription fee, I know one does not have to choose to pay and I am one of them, I initially purchased the app and I know apps go thru updates and development and that takes $$$ but honestly maybe a yearly fee that is more reasonable would be more acceptable.

For me having part of an app that I paid for that is now not accessible due to an update unless I pay a fee has caused me to move to a different app for my weather needs, I wish the developer the best for this app but for me it’s just not worth it.

UPDATE, UPDATE, UPDATE !!!!!!L

Seems the new update wants a monthly fee now, the reason I purchase apps is so I don’t have to keep buying but seems the developer wants a monthly subscription for future weather ???

Unless I am missing something when you click on future weather you are taken to a screen that want to sell it to you for like $0.99 per month, no thanks if that’s the case as that’s I bought the app in the first place so guess I need to go on the hunt for a new weather app, what a shame.

Have had this app on my older iPhone 5s for a long time and worked great and then upgraded to the iPhone X and still works great but locks up tight on my iPad Pro, running the latest updates and it goes thru then install fine but when I launch it the app displays the radar and does nothing and nothing you touch within the app works, hopefully this will get addressed in the next update as I like the app a lot",1581,648138137a3b99eab486989c
86,Disaster Alert,"This app is an eye opener, providing a barometer for overall planetary events. By constant monitoring, it becomes easy to differentiate between areas hit by random events and those area which are repeatedly struck yet possessing causal connections.  Impossible to remain a passive citizen with so many in need of help. 

The concepts I communicate are not simple casual observations, but rather, in these times, areas being struck using a paradigms which states, the Designer, will use whatever force necessary to cull out those factors contributing to over all planetary decay, as influenced by then moral (or lack there of)  ethical stance of the people affected.

It's interesting to study large land masses and the people inhabiting those areas. Save for islands and segment nations positioned on vastly active plate regions, there is a definite connection between the disasters of say, Japan and The US both of which share is compablw moral decadence.  

There are some locations, skilled with manipulation of stated freedoms for those whom they deceive, 

Japan has an well concealed pornograaphic home delivery system establishes with salons and hotel backing that goes beyond comprehension.

87,Noonlight: Feel Protected 24/7,"I've been using SafeTrek for awhile now - since before there was a monthly fee, in any case. The security I feel knowing that I'm holding onto a deadman's switch and all I have to do to call for help is drop my phone? It's well worth a couple of dollars a month. 

Over the holiday break, I visited my parents at our rural home. At one in the morning in the middle of a rainstorm, the cows started mooing as if something was wrong. Concerned, I went outside with a heavy flashlight and my thumb on this app, just in case. It turned out the cows were fine, nobody had escaped, no one was trying to hurt them (which is unlikely, but that was the reason I used SafeTrek that night, just in case)... The silly cows were just standing outside in the rain for no reason, yelling loudly enough to hear from the house. Well, everything was fine, but the rain caused my phone's touchscreen to malfunction so that I had trouble inputting my code before the ten seconds were up. I was able to confirm by text that I was okay, so no one called the police on the cows. :)

The follow-up was above and beyond, though: the SafeTrek team texted me a couple days later to check in, make sure I was fine, and say they were glad it was a false alarm. I felt like I was in good hands. 

I hope I never have to use this app for real, but knowing that it seems to work like it's supposed to is a huge comfort! 

I'm about to walk to the bus stop in an unfamiliar part of the city at 10 p.m., and you can bet I'll be using SafeTrek for the hundredth time so I feel prepared and I don't have to worry!",1577,648136937a3b99eab4868abe
88,Noonlight: Feel Protected 24/7,Last year probably around November my dad was working over time so it was just me my mom and brother. I remember I went to grab something from the closet and I noticed the basement door closed (which was open just a few minutes before) so I asked my mom if she had closed it. She said “no. why?”. Me being the worry wart I am started to freak out. Then my mom started to walk over towards the basement door and kinda stopped. She asked my brother “did you put a toy behind the door?” He wasn’t paying attention earlier and just said no. I got even more sacred and asked her why she asked him that. She said “because the door is moving.” That was when I started crying. So my mom told us to hide. We hid behind the dog crate and she went into her room to get her gun(which she has a permit for) and I started crying even harder and my brother was laughing saying that I was just joking but this was no joke it was serious. When my mom came out from her room she had her gun out in front of her and went into the basement to look around. She was probably only down there for a couple minutes but it felt like an eternity. Eventually I made my way downstairs and asked her what was going on. “I don’t think anyone is down here but the basement door (leading to outside) was wide open.” she slowly said still looking around. I’m still to this day sacred of that. I wish I would have had safe trek back then. Thankfully no one was hurt but who knows what could have happened. I really wish I would have had safe trek back then if my mom didn’t have a gun we could’ve died.,1567,648136937a3b99eab4867765
89,Amber Weather,"Seconds after you install this piece of garbage sorry excuse of for an app, 
you start getting pop up ads regardless of what screen you're in on your 
phone. It's just flat out Disgusting. I'm so sick and tired of people doing 
passion-less work, wanting only to make a quick buck either through ad 
bombardedment or by harvesting data on their users to then sell off to 
those people making these ads in the first place. Take a moment to read 
through all the reviews regarding ads. There is absolutely no doubt 
whatsoever that they are fully aware of how annoying intrusive, & 
bothersome there ads are. Over half of the replies from these talentless 
devs specifically regarding the huge ad problem is a very poor masked 
version of ""tough luck, don't care"". Something very similar to ""sorry 
you've got some kind a problem with our ads, thanks for using our app and 
have a nice day."" almost as many of their replies also add a comment along 
the lines of ""sorry you don't like the ads but that's how we're getting 
paid so you best find a way to deal with it, oh and you have yourself a 
nice day"". Which I guarantee they add to the end if their replies purely 
out of condescension. Additionally and though I am just assuming here, it 
seems fairly obvious that the devs of this app aren't native English 
speakers and therefore presumably not within the US which further 
disinclines them from from caring one bit about their users. This is 
nothing more than an overseas scam to either steal their users data or 
pummel us then with ads for a quick buck",1562,648093f510211d840c77c276
90,FEMA,"The most blatant and obvious issue with an app such as this, is that you're assuming that you're going to have a cell phone and/or wifi signal sufficient enough to receive any information on any sort of disaster AFTER it has happened.  What cell phone service that is accessible is generally bogged down with everyone trying to call their loved ones at the same time, which will also render this app completely useless. If you need updates, get a solar powered am radio and look into cell phones that use GIS and satellite technologies...

By FEMA releasing this, it sheds a bit of light at just how brain-dead this completely useless agency is. An app to be used on a device that will not work during a disaster? Good one…

The bottom line is that an educated and prepared populous is ready to act when needed, and we certainly don't need to rely on the Federal Government to tell us something has already happened- heck, they release an app that will never work during a disaster! There's a hurricane or a giant asteroid rocketing toward earth? Great! Your local authorities are all you have ever needed. Stay informed without having your hand held by the Feds. Stock up on what you and your family needs, learn how to be resourceful and learn how to read a map and shoot an azimuth.

After this post in iTunes, this app gets deleted! While this may be a cynically-laced review, I'm simply trying to be frank about an app that is just completely stupid in every way, shape and form. Everyone has the tools they need- and that is your senses and common sense.",1560,64812b8c7a3b99eab48608b3
91,Noonlight: Feel Protected 24/7,"I’ve actually felt way safer by using this app.

But let’s be honest, You can call 911 for free.

Not only that but I found an interesting article, which says:

“Reaching the Authorities in an Emergency. Sometimes a defunct cell phone will still be able to call 911. In order for the phone to call 911, it has to have a working signal. It does not have to have a contract with a carrier (meaning you can't call any other number and can't receive calls)”

You can also ask Siri to call emergency services and they’ll transfer you within 3 seconds by just activating “Hey Siri”

Police usually would call back or track down the number and send someone to check up on the location, even if it was a call by mistake.

The app is for a good cause and I’m thankful it’s up there but I don’t think you should take advantage of people’s safety to make an income.

Not everyone has $3 to spare.

I barely have a dollar in change myself and have basically a very tight budget.

For all you know, they could be using a government phone because they can’t afford to pay for a phone service.

There’s a case of a woman who was preventing an intruder from entering her house because she was afraid he would hurt her daughter.

She went on to call the police and he broke into the room and the dispatcher told her to say she had the police on the line. It still didn’t prevent her from being sexually abused by the man.

Not every safety method is 100% successful.

I say stick to using voice command to call emergency services on your device.",1528,648136937a3b99eab4867ff2
92,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"The premise of this app is great, however, I honestly have to mute it’s notifications because I get too many, and majority of which don’t pertain to my own, nor the safety of those around me. I really DO NOT care about someone’s dog that went ran away 3.5 miles away from me when I live in a very urban area. Or a car accident with minor injuries several miles away. At one point, I became so dismissive with the notifications that there was actually a serious incident that happened near me, that I didn’t know about because I figured it was just a notification of some couple arguing on the other side of town again. Think the boy who cried wolf. That’s what this app’s notifications are giving without relevant notification filtering. 

I also live in Chicago, so any time there’s any crime — no matter how small —MAGA-nation and the other racist trolls flood the comments with unrelated and unprovoked vulgarities about the (black) mayor and (black) state attorney, along with blatant profanity regarding the race/socio-economic status of the undescribed/unidentified suspected perpetrator(s) that on ANY other app would get them permanently banned; Yet on this one no action is taken.  

It’s hard enough hearing about all the alleged crime going on around you, but to then have to read comments of other ‘citizens’ that somehow fit within Citizen’s “Community Guidelines” that are plain-text racial slurs, unrelated, untrue, uncalled-for, and seemingly unmoderated? The app is not worth it; it does more harm than good.",1525,6481297c7a3b99eab485f57e
93,The Weather Channel,"On Mother's Day this year (2018), your app failed me and my family at the 
time we needed it most. The results of this failure could have been 
disastrous. We were experiencing severe thunderstorms throughout the day. A 
storm rolled through in the evening that was fairly intense. It only lasted 
for a little while. A few hours later one of my wife's friends frantically 
texted asking if we were okay. Apparently during that storm a tornado 
rolled through our tiny little town. The funnel was a hundred yards wide 
and it was TWO BLOCKS from our house. Mind you, I'm not talking about two 
CITY blocks, I'm talking about two TINY blocks in a TINY like town. It is 
scary enough to think that it was so close to us. It is even more scary to 
realize that we were completely oblivious to its presence. We never 
received a tornado watch or tornado warning through the app. You better 
believe I would have run to the basement with my wife, our two year old, 
and our seven month old had I thought that anything like that was going on 
down the street. We took a walk the next day and thankfully no homes were 
leveled. No people lost their lives. There were however several trees 
uprooted throughout the community, power out in certain areas, and homes 
with minor damage. Some homeowners experienced broken windows and siding 
that had been torn off. Again, we are simply flabbergasted that this app 
failed to let us know about such a serious and potentially life-threatening 
situation. I don't know what else to say.",1523,6480a525d58440aff0388284
94,MyRadar Weather Radar Pro,"I have been searching for a good weather app for months now. It gets really annoying sometimes because either the weather app spans you with ads or they make you pay crazy amounts of money just to see an hourly forecast. Now if you are using an iPhone this app is not necessary but I still recommend you highly to download it. The reason is because iPhone already has a default weather app. On the other hand, iPad doesn’t have the default weather app. If you are an iPad user you must download this app. My first reason is: this app is a combination of a radar and accurate forecast. On the apple default app, they only give you a forecast. The second reason: it gives you notifications about emergency situations such as tornados. My third reason: this app is very customizable. Even without paying the subscription, you can customize it however you like. The fourth reason: it gives you a detailed description of the weather. It shows you what it feels like. It gives you the week forecast, hourly forecast and much more! I recommend this app for everyone. Don’t waste your time on other apps with too many ads. Even though this app has a few ads, they don’t take up the whole screen and they don’t come constantly. If you want a good weather app, download this app. A lot of the apps out there make you pay a lot of money to download their apps. This app is free! A huge thanks to the developers for creating such a good weather app. I hope you can make nice improvements that will make this app even better for user!",1521,648133c77a3b99eab4865b14
95,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"This app is dying now that they've accidentally doxxed a celebrity, so they're trying to get as much money as they can before they shut down completely. 

They removed coverage for my city and now I get no updates or alerts for anything nearby. They'll tell you about all the other cities with noteworthy local events but not the one I live in? How is that helpful? It's just a Breaking News app now.  Not beneficial for people who downloaded it for its intended use: to be aware of crime in your area and keep yourself safe. 

The Premium feature only advertises having ""live customer support"" and someone monitoring your location incase you feel unsafe... doesn't seem worth $20 when other apps have that service for free. Premium doesn't even unlock the features it originally had like getting alerts for your area. 

Other features that don't work: 
-You used to be able to message your friends on Citizen and send them alerts. Very helpful because I wasn't always checking the app, but my friends and I would reach out to each other if there were reports nearby. 
-Friend feature doesn't work: App will tell you when your friends have joined the app, and says ""Tap to Connect"", but the button just takes you to your current friends list and doesn't actually give you a way to add them. When you go to another part of the app to add friends, it just sends you to a list of your contacts where you can send a link to invite people to join. Doesn't actually show you a list of people already on the app to connect with.",1521,6481297c7a3b99eab485f6dd

Pay to use now

I've had this app for a couple of years now, and I really enjoyed it previously.
Unfortunately, every single time I open this app now, I'm bombarded with subscription notices. If you are not paying for this app, you can't really get access to much of anything. Some alerts are free, but many alerts require a paid subscription to even see what the incident is. On the incidents which are free, if you listen or watch any of the videos some stop midway and tell you that you cannot finish the recording unless you upgrade your subscription. What's the point of having a ""free app,"" if I then have to pay to find out what the incident is? I might as well not have the app! Other problems with the application is the false alerts and unmonitored comments. The comments most of the time are rude; which often range between blaming the homeless or victims in incidences. There's no monitoring comments... beside the ""don't be rude"" warning you get when opening the chat box. There's a number of alerts that come through that aren't verified. Verified alerts are part of the subscription, so you very likely will get false alerts. This app relies heavily on its users as it's sources, yet turns around and makes you pay for the content they aren't paying for themselves. For a free application that was meant to let citizens know of major incidents happening around them for their safety, it sure feels like they have prioritized their own pockets before the",1521,6481297c7a3b99eab485f718
97,Tornado - American Red Cross,"Initial download and setup showed location in another state where I vacationed a week ago, and there was no option to change it.  Next screen, however, showed my home address where I am currently. Added my daughter's zip code in another state and it accepted and showed correctly, but there was no option to remove it so I could enter a specific address.  Tested tornado alert siren.  Ye gads (glad I am old enough to know that phrase to print instead of what I was actually thinking)!!!  The siren would not stop and there is no off button!  Clicking out of app did not stop it.  Going to the controls page and turning off notification sounds and alerts did not stop it.  No tornados in my area, either.  Thought this would be so great because we have heard later today will bring severe thunderstorms with potential of tornados. Had to TURN OFF iPad sound.  Have not tried to turn it on again because it upset my dogs so much.  Recommend more user-end controls.  Without user control to delete locations AND to turn off the siren, this is virtually useless.  I guess I will have to delete the app. Hope someone reads this and lets me know of fixes.  It is a great idea, but who wants to sit in a meeting (or at home) and have it go off erroneously and not be able to turn the siren off?  However, it works almost as well as the red cross weather radio we bought a few years ago.  Second one, worked as well as the first and this.  Hope that meaning is clear - none of the three worked well enough to be dependable!!",1517,648139067a3b99eab486a6a9
98,Citizen: Local Safety Alerts,"It's a decent app but it needs some work. It would be nice if, in addition to using your current location, you could manually set a small number of ""frequent locations"" with a specific zip code and a radius so that you could still receive notifications about major incidents around the city, but the bulk of the alerts would be for things that happen within the area(s) you specified, even if you're not currently there (notifications about home while you're at work) or if you turn your location off and on as needed like I do (I don't actually go many places, mostly just to work and back home, so I usually only have it on in if I'm using taxi or map apps, or as a precaution if I'm going out or to some unfamiliar place).  Notifications themselves are sporadic: I can literally go a couple of weeks without seeing any and then suddenly I'll get seven or eight in one day. If I leave location on, I get notified about things going on miles away much more often than I get notified about things happening less than 1 mile away, and if I turn location off, the app gets stuck telling me about wherever I was the last time it was on. I also wish there was a way to customize what types of notifications you get and when. There's no way to do that without completely blocking notifications, which defeats the purpose of the app, but at the same time I don't really want to be getting multiple notifications in the middle of the night that some person is live streaming some minor incident halfway across the city.",1512,648093ceba8226394e6ce4e0
99,NOAA Weather Radar Live & Alerts,"Way to many ads.  Resize; ad.  Change settings; ad.  Pan; ad.  Zoom;ad.  Every 20 seconds; ad.... And these full page ads are in addition to a bottom banner ad...   Everyone who complains about this gets a completely canned response from Apalon so that just tells me Apalon won't make changes and isn't listening.  If it weren't for the ad frequency I'd rate it much higher (5).  In its current state I'd rate it (2), but I'm giving it (1) star because of Apalon's canned responses to all PREVIOUS reviews that note this absurd ad frequency.    Let's see how they respond to me because I think that my advice to them to tone the ads down is legitimate considering. If they acknowledge that I'll reevaluate my review rating and I'll bump my review to (2).  I'll bump to a (5) once ads are actually served at a ""normal free version rate.""   Finally, as a developer myself, I get it, the free version has ads and there needs to be a catalyst to upgrade.  That said, the frequency is just too high; obscenely high.  If I can't evaluate the app experience without getting served an ad every 10-20 seconds I won't upgrade and will just find an alternative.    Case in point, my friend's Google gadgets made him 60k a year in revenue with just 180k passive users back in the day (mid 2000s).  Tone the ads down and you'll likely get more free users and therefore ad revenue.  Treat us like the goose that laid the golden egg and we'll just dump the app.  I'll keep evaluating, but it's Weather Channel until then...",1508,6480950d991eb46aaf10c41a
