    "Content": "I like the updates. As part of the beta program, I understood that things were in developing/testing stages and assumed there would be big changes. I'll say that it is quite different and took some getting used to. Once I trained my brain to know where everything is, I'm rather enjoying it. I like the main screen, has all the basic info, including allergens, which is helpful living in FL. The weekly forecast is nice and I enjoy the extended radar, as well as the options for satellites, etc.",
